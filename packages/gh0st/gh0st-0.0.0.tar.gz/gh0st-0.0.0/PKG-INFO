        ## TODO
        
        ### Key
        [**+**] feature to be added  
        [**x**] change in code  
        [**-**] bug to be removed  
        [**?**] uncertain how to proceed  
        
        ### Tasks
        
        [**+**] add badges to gitlab <3  
        [**+**] upload to PyPI  
        `├──`   write working demo  
        `└──`   tag first release  
        [**+**] SE logic needs to be fuzzy, contradictable, and maybe not all revealed, but able to reveal by prodding/getting skill/familiarity?  
        `└──`   SE demo?  
        [**+**] Need to keep better track of window size to prevent errors from making and using windows that are larger  
        [**+**] match window size on create&resize  
        [**+**] use old option&menu as base class?
