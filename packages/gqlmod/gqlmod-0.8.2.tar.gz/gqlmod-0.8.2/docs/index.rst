gqlmod: Importing GraphQL
=========================

gqlmod allows you to import GraphQL Query (``.gql``) files as modules and call
the queries and mutations defined there. It will validate your queries at
import time, to surface any problems as soon as possible.

gqlmod also defines mechanisms for handling different services (called providers)
and different contexts with those services.
