Output description
==================


*ThorAxe* has two command-line programs, `transcript_query` and `thoraxe`. The
first downloads from Ensembl_ the inputs for the second.


transcript_query
----------------

::

    transcript_query PAX6 -l homo_sapiens,mus_musculus,xenopus_tropicalis,danio_rerio

Running the previous line is going to create a `PAX6` folder with an `Ensembl`
subfolder. That last folder contains four files with information downloaded
from *Ensembl*. In this case, the information corresponds to the transcripts
and exons from the human *PAX6* gene and all their one-to-one orthologs in the
indicated species:

::

    PAX6
    └── Ensembl
        ├── ensembl_version.csv
        ├── exonstable.tsv
        ├── sequences.fasta
        ├── tree.nh
        └── tsl.csv

The `ensembl_version.csv` file contains a table with information about the
download date and hour together with the *Ensembl* version.

thoraxe
-------

We can run `thoraxe` in the `PAX6` folder that `transcript_query` created with
the *Ensembl* data:

::

    thoraxe -i PAX6 --phylosofs --plot_chimerics

*ThorAxe* is going to look for the `Ensembl` folder with the input data and is
going to create a `thoraxe` folder containing the final and intermediate
results of the study. The `--phylosofs` and `--plot_chimerics` arguments are
optionals.

The `s_exon_table.csv` file has the tidy (denormalized) output data for
the **orthologous exonic regions (s-exons)**. Each row is an observation of an
s-exon in a particular transcript. Rows are in order, following the s-exon rank.
That means that the concatenation of the s-exon sequences for each
transcript gives the protein isoform sequence.

The `splice_graph.gml` is the splice graph of s-exons in all the
transcripts/species using the human-readable *Graph Modelling Language* (GML)
format. Each node and edge has conservation information, where conservation
means the fraction of species showing that particular node (s-exon) or
connection.

The `path_table.csv` contains information about each transcript as a path in
the splice graph. The first row indicates the *canonical path*. The canonical
path is used to detect alternative splicing events automatically, and it is
the one present in the largest number of genes/species with the highest
minimal value of `transcript_weighted_conservation`, and it is the longest. The
alternative splicing events are stored in the `ases_table.csv` file where the
canonical path and the alternative are indicated, together with conservation
(number of genes showing the path) information.

The `msa` folder has a multiple sequence alignment for each s-exon, e.g.
`msa_s_exon_10_0.fasta`. This MSAs can be easily used as a seed to
look for homologous sequences in different databases by using hmmsearch_.

Splice graph
............

*ThorAxe* splice graph as *s-exons*, rather than exon, as nodes. Using *s-exon*
allows us to represent transcripts from different species in the same splice
graph. As a consequence, the edges indicate the connectivity between these
exonic regions and not necessarily junctions between genomic exons. *GML* is a
rich format, and we used it to store useful metadata for nodes and edges:


================================ ===============================================
            Metadata                              Description
================================ ===============================================
label                            The s-exon ID (only for nodes).
transcript_fraction              It is the number of transcripts showing that
                                 node/edge over the total number of transcripts,
                                 taking into account all the genes.
conservation                     Fraction of genes showing that node/edge.
transcript_weighted_conservation As `conservation` but each gene is weighted
                                 using the fraction of transcripts in that
                                 gene showing that edge (only for edges).
genes                            List of genes, separated by commas,
                                 showing that node/edge.
transcripts                      List of transcripts, separated by commas,
                                 showing that node/edge.
================================ ===============================================


.. note::
    If *ThorAxe's* `transcript_query` is run with `--orthology 1:1` (default),
    the number of genes is identical to the number of species in the dataset.


phylosofs
~~~~~~~~~

The `phylosofs` folder has the needed inputs for the structural and molecular
modelling pipelines of PhyloSofS_. It is only generated when the `--phylosofs`
optional argument is used.
These PhyloSofS's files use a single unicode character to represent each s-exon.
The mapping between the id for *PhyloSofS* and the one of *ThorAxe*
(*ExonCluster_ChimericBlock*) is in the `s_exons.tsv` file.

The `transcripts.pir` has the annotated sequence using the PIR format.

The list of transcripts for each gene is in `transcripts.txt`

Intermediate outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `_intermediate` folder has intermediate files and states from the *ThorAxe*
pipeline. In particular, `cluster_plots.html` has the interactive plots of the
chimeric alignments, with the possibility to show the `constitutive` value
calculated for each subexon. This plot is only generated when the
`--plot_chimerics` optional argument is indicated.

.. warning::
    `cluster_plots.html` loads the `cluster_data.js` file that includes
    all the information needed to plot all the generated multiple sequence alignments
    using *Plotly*. It can freeze the tab when a lot of sequences/species are used or
    if the computer hasn't enough resources available.
