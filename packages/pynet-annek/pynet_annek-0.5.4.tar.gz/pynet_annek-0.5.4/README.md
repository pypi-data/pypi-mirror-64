# pynet #
A cli tool for interacting with network switches

## Synopsis ##

> pynet is a cli tool for running adhoc commands and getting version information and configurations
> from network devices. It stores devices in a sqlite database. It can then query those devices and
> store some basic information about devices in the database.
>
> pynet supports csv import of devices to the database. If you have a bunch of network devices that
> are configured via ssh and you need to retrieve version information from all of those devices, pynet
> can help you accomplish that task.
>
> pynet is a basic tool created to perform some necessary tasks quickly. It is not complete by any
> stretch of the imagination. The user should be willing to look at the source code and possibly
> use the cli to sqlite to massage the db if necessary.
