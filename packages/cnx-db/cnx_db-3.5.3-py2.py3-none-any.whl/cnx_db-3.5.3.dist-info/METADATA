2.6.2
-----

 - more migration script bugfixes

2.6.1
-----

 - bugfix in db migration script (need db superuser)

2.6.0
-----

 - Jenkins CI framework and initial support
 - Generate collexion.xml files for new (minor rev)
   collections that do not have them.

-----

- Move html abstract trigger to later event
- make schema restorable
  (cf. https://bucardo.org/postgres_all_versions.html#version_9.3.22
  re: search_path settings)

2.3.2
-----

- Correct trigger to transform abstracts to html from cnxml.
  See https://github.com/Connexions/cnx-db/issues/138

2.3.1
-----

- Add trigger to transform abstracts to html from cnxml.
  See https://github.com/Connexions/cnx-db/issues/138

2.3.0
-----

- Add database indices and modify the fulltext trigger to set different
  weights to tsvectors based on whether they are generated on titles, keywords
  or text.

2.2.1
-----

- Add an index to dramatically speed up `/contents/<book-id>@ver:<pageid>@ver`

2.2.0
-----

- Add a SQL query to obtain the 'head' version of content. The head
  is the last publication made for that content regardless of whether
  it is in a publicly viewable state.

2.1.0
-----

- Adds fulltext search fixes and speedups.

2.0.1
-----

- Fix the documentation for Pyramid integration properties.
- Fix the HTML reference resolver for cases where the moduleid is found
  in the resource filename.

2.0.0
-----

- Transition the following Pyramid integration properties:
  ``registry.engines`` and ``registry.tables``. These are now moved to
  ``request.get_db_engine()`` and ``request.db_tables``.
  This favors the recommended pattern of using request methods and attributes
  for hooking into the current thread local variable space.

1.6.1
-----

- Fix shred_collxml code to insert the ``trees.latest`` value.
  The fix includes a migration to ensure all ``trees.latest`` values are
  set to true, which should be the casee for all legacy content.
  See https://github.com/Connexions/cnx-db/issues/120 for issue details.

1.6.0
-----

- Pin to a specific version of sesssion_exec when testing.
- Allow the Google Analytics (GA) code column to stay the same type,
  but contain multiple GA codes. Adjustments to queries make this
  an array of GA codes based on space separated list of codes.
- Adjust the books containing this page query to:
  - Provide a sorted list of authors and the detailed person info
  - Provide the shortid

1.5.1
-----

- Remove the ``DB_NAME`` environment variable from the container definition.
  This appears to have become redundant with the ``POSTGRES_DB`` variable.
- Fix .dockerfiles/initdb.d/00_initdb.sh to look for ``*.sql``
  and ``*.sql.gz`` files in the docker entrypoint directory rather than
  the current working directory.

1.5.0
-----

- Simplify slim dump import into docker container

  - Rename .dockerfiles/initdb.d/initdb.sh to 00_initdb.sh
  - Don't run cnx-db init if ``*.sql`` or ``*.sql.gz`` exist
  - Remove .dockerfiles/initdb.d/load_database_dump.sh
  - Set POSTGRES_DB to the same as DB_NAME

- Add the baked and print-style columns to the module metadata query.

1.4.0
-----

- Massage testing fixtures to better facilitate testing in packages using
  this package.

  - Provide additional init and wipe fixtures scoped at the module level.
  - Remove custom function for table name lookup. Replaced by sqlalchemy
    Inspector methods.
  - Add a ``db_tables`` pytest fixture that supplies sqlalchemy table objects.

1.3.0
-----

- Add a new baking state, known as 'fallback', that allows content
  to remain in a success state even when the latest print-style
  won't work with the content.
- Fix the primary key on the ``print_style_recipes`` table.
- Provide docs for using the Pyramid Web Framework with this package.
- Add a database tables definition to the pyramid integration.
  This places a ``tables`` attribute on the registry.
  The attribute contains sqlalchemy table definitions that are reflected
  from the existing database schema.

1.2.0
-----

- Fix settings discovery to use the given settings value for 'db.common.url'
  when the ``DB_URL`` environment variable is undefined.
- Add a read-only database setting to allow for read-only database
  connections. The setting is available through the ``DB_READONLY_URL``
  environment variable.
