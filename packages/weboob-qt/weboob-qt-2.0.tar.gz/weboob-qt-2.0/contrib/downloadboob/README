This script can be used to automatically download videos matching some criteria.

To avoid to download a video twice, all videos are stored in an unique way: .files/<backend name>/<video_id>.avi

For each entry in the configuration file, the script:
- checks for new video
- downloads the new videos
- creates a link from <user specified name>/<video.name>.avi to .files/<backend name>/<video_id>.avi

In each section of the configuration file :
- backend: the backend to use
- pattern: specify the search pattern
- title_exclude: a pipe separated list. If an item in this list is a substring of the title, then the video is ignored.
- id_regexp: an optional regular expression that the video id must match
- max_results: maximum number of result to parse
- directory: the <user specified name> above.

Usage:
  downloadboob [path/to/file.conf] [section1 [section2 ...]]

If /etc/downloadboob.conf or ~/downloadboob.conf is found, it will be used.
If sections are specifed, only those are downloaded. By default, all sections of the config file are downloaded.
