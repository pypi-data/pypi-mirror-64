.SH CONDITION
The \-c and \-\-condition is a flexible way to filter and get only interesting results. It supports conditions on numerical values, dates, durations and strings. Dates are given in YYYY\-MM\-DD or YYYY\-MM\-DD HH:MM format. Durations look like XhYmZs where X, Y and Z are integers. Any of them may be omitted. For instance, YmZs, XhZs or Ym are accepted.
The syntax of one expression is "\fBfield operator value\fR". The field to test is always the left member of the expression.
.LP
The field is a member of the objects returned by the command. For example, a bank account has "balance", "coming" or "label" fields.
.SS The following operators are supported:
.TP
=
Test if object.field is equal to the value.
.TP
!=
Test if object.field is not equal to the value.
.TP
>
Test if object.field is greater than the value. If object.field is date, return true if value is before that object.field.
.TP
<
Test if object.field is less than the value. If object.field is date, return true if value is after that object.field.
.TP
|
This operator is available only for string fields. It works like the Unix standard \fBgrep\fR command, and returns True if the pattern specified in the value is in object.field.
.SS Expression combination
.LP
You can make a expression combinations with the keywords \fB" AND "\fR, \fB" OR "\fR an \fB" LIMIT "\fR.
.LP
The \fBLIMIT\fR keyword can be used to limit the number of items upon which running the expression. \fBLIMIT\fR can only be placed at the end of the expression followed by the number of elements you want.
.SS Examples:
.nf
.B boobank ls \-\-condition 'label=Livret A'

.PP
.nf
.B boobank ls \-\-condition 'balance>10000'
