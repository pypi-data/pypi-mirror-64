Description: ## Quasilinear data representations for single-cell omics data analysis
        
        Quasildr is a python library for quasilinear data representation methods. 
        It mainly implements two methods, a quasilinear data representation or visualization 
        method **GraphDR** and a generalized trajectory extraction and inference method **StructDR** (StructDR is based on nonparametric ridge estimation). The Quasildr package is developed for 
        single-cell omics data analysis, but supports other 
        data types as well. 
        
        
        ## Install
        
        Run `pip install .` in this directory or use `pip install quasildr`.
        
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        For quick start, see tutorials under `./tutorials/` directory.
        
        An example python snippet that running these methods are below
        
        ```python
        #GraphDR 
        import quasildr.graphdr import graphdr
        Z = graphdr(X_pca, regularization=500)
        
        #StructDR
        import quasildr.structdr import Scms
        Z = Z / Z[:,0].std()
        s = Scms(Z, bw=0.1, min_radius = 10)
        T = s.scms(Z)
        ```
        
        If you are analyzing single-cell data, you may consider using our 
        graphical interface for single-cell omics data analysis [Trenti](#graphical-interface).

        See documentation [here](https://quasildr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/main.html).
        
        ### GraphDR - visualization and general-purpose representation: 
        GraphDR is a nonlinear representation method 
        that preserves the interpretation of a corresponding linear space, while being able to well represent cell
         identities like nonlinear methods. Unlike popular nonlinear methods, GraphDR allows direct 
         comparison across datasets by applying a common linear transform. GraphDR also supports incorporating 
         complex experiment design through graph construction (see example from manuscript and ./Manuscript directory). 
         GraphDR is also very fast. It can process a 1.5 million-cell dataset in 5min (CPU) or 1.5min (CPU) and 
         can easily scale to even larger datasets.

        ### StructDR - flexible structure extraction and inference of confidence sets: 
        StructDR is based on nonparametric density ridge estimation (NRE). StructDR is a flexible framework 
        for structure extraction for single-cell data that unifies cluster, trajectory, and surface estimation 
        by casting these problems as identifying 0-, 1-, and 2- dimensional density ridges. StructDR also support
         adaptively decides ridge dimensionality based on data. When used with linear representation such as PCA, 
         StructDR allows inference of confidence sets of density ridge positions. This allows, for example, 
         estimation of uncertainties of the developmental trajectories extracted.

        ## Command-line tools 
        
        We provide command-line tools for quick access to most commonly used quasildr functions, with typical data preprocessing and post processing options built-in. You can add the `-h` option to access help information to each tool.
        
        * run_graphdr.py
        ```
        python run_graphdr.py ./example/Dentate_Gyrus.spliced_data.gz --pca --plot --log --transpose --max_dim 50 --refine_iter 4 --reg 500 --no_rotation --anno_file ./example/Dentate_Gyrus.anno.gz --anno_column ClusterName 
        ```
        
        * run_structdr.py
        ```
        python run_structdr.py --input ./example/Dentate_Gyrus.spliced_data.gz.dim50_k10_reg500_n4t12_pca_no_rotation_log_scale_transpose.drgraph --anno_file ./example/Dentate_Gyrus.anno.gz --anno_column ClusterName  --output ./example/Dentate_Gyrus.spliced_data.gz.dim50_k10_reg500_n4t12_pca_no_rotation_log_scale_transpose.drgraph
        ```
        
        ## Graphical Interface - Trenti
        
        We developed a web-based GUI, Trenti (Trajectory exploration interface), for single cell data visualization and exploratory analysis, supporting GraphDR, StructDR, common dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, and provide a 3D interface for visualization and a gene expression exploration interface. 
        
        To use Trenti, you need to install additional dependencies:
        `pip install umap-learn dash==1.9.1 dash-colorscales networkx`
        
        See [./trenti/README.md](https://github.com/jzthree/quasildr/blob/master/trenti/README.md) for details. For a quick-start example, run
        ` python ./trenti/app.py -i ./example/Dentate_Gyrus.data_pca.gz   -f ./example/Dentate_Gyrus.spliced_data.gz -a ./example/Dentate_Gyrus.anno.gz  --samplelimit=5000 --log --mode graphdr`
