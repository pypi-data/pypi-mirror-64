Emacs & rna-tools
============================================================

rna-tools can be used side-by-side https://github.com/mmagnus/emacs-pdb-mode to edit files structural files in the PDB format.

Emacs /ˈiːmæks/ and its derivatives are a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility.[2] The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as "the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor". Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s and continues actively as of 2017. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs)

pdb-mode (https://github.com/mmagnus/emacs-pdb-mode not authored by me, I'm a maintainer, and a beginner developer) is an emacs-lisp minor mode for Emacs to perform a number of useful editing functions on Protein DataBank (PDB) formatted files. XEmacs and/or GNU Emacs are available for most computing platforms.
