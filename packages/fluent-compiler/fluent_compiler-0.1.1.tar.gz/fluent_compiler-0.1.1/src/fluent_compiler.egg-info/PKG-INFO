Description: fluent-compiler
        ===============
        
        This is a Python implementation of Project Fluent, a localization
        framework designed to unleash the entire expressive power of natural
        language translations.
        
        It provides a different implementation from the official
        `fluent.runtime <https://github.com/projectfluent/python-fluent>`__
        implementation, distinguished mainly by:
        
        -  strategy: we compile FTL files to Python AST
        -  speed: as a result of the above, plus optimizations, we get blazing
           fast performance, especially when combined with PyPy which can
           further optimize.
        -  compile-time checking and error reporting
        -  'escapers' feature for handling things like HTML escaping/embedding
           correctly.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        This code was originally developed as part of ``fluent.runtime``, as an
        alternative implementation of ``FluentBundle``, but never got merged to
        the master branch. We are in the process of pulling it out as a separate
        package.
        
        It has seen usage in production a dependency of ``django-ftl`` for a
        long time. However, now that we don't need full compatibility with
        ``fluent.runtime`` it will be modified further in terms of interface.
