fluent-compiler
===============

This is a Python implementation of Project Fluent, a localization
framework designed to unleash the entire expressive power of natural
language translations.

It provides a different implementation from the official
`fluent.runtime <https://github.com/projectfluent/python-fluent>`__
implementation, distinguished mainly by:

-  strategy: we compile FTL files to Python AST
-  speed: as a result of the above, plus optimizations, we get blazing
   fast performance, especially when combined with PyPy which can
   further optimize.
-  compile-time checking and error reporting
-  'escapers' feature for handling things like HTML escaping/embedding
   correctly.

Status
------

This code was originally developed as part of ``fluent.runtime``, as an
alternative implementation of ``FluentBundle``, but never got merged to
the master branch. We are in the process of pulling it out as a separate
package.

It has seen usage in production a dependency of ``django-ftl`` for a
long time. However, now that we don't need full compatibility with
``fluent.runtime`` it will be modified further in terms of interface.
