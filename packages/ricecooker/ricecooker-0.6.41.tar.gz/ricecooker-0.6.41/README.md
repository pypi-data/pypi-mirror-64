ricecooker
==========
The `ricecooker` library is a framework for creating Kolibri content channels and
uploading them to [Kolibri Studio](https://studio.learningequality.org/), which
is the central content server that [Kolibri](http://learningequality.org/kolibri/)
applications talk to when they import content.

The Kolibri content pipeline is pictured below:

![The Kolibri Content Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learningequality/ricecooker/master/docs/figures/content_pipeline_diagram.png)

This `ricecooker` framework is the "main actor" in the first part of the content
pipeline, and touches all aspects of the pipeline within the region highlighted
in blue in the above diagram.


Before we continue, let's have some definitions:
  - A **Kolibri channel** is a tree-like data structure that consist of the following content nodes:
    - Topic nodes (folders)
    - Content types:
      - Document (`pdf` and `epub` files)
      - Audio (`mp3` files)
      - Video (`mp4` files and subtitles)
      - HTML5App `h5p` files and `zip` files (generic container for web content: HTML+JS+CSS)
      - Exercises
  - A **sushi chef** is a Python script that uses the `ricecooker` library to
    import content from various sources, organize content into Kolibri channels
    and upload the channel to Kolibri Studio.



## Overview

Use the following shortcuts to jump to the most relevant parts of the `ricecooker`
documentation depending on your role:

  - **Content specialists and Administrators** can read the non-technical part
    of the documentation to learn about how content works in the Kolibri platform.
    - The best place to start is the [Kolibri Platform overview](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/platform/introduction.md).
    - Read more about the supported [content types here](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/platform/content_types.md)
    - Content curators can consult [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1slwoNT90Wqu0Rr8MJMAEsA-9LWLRvSeOgdg9u7HrZB8/edit?usp=sharing)
      for information about how to prepare "spec sheets" that guide developers how
      to import content into the Kolibri ecosystem.
    - The Non-technical of particular interest is the [CSV workflow](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/csv_metadata/README.md)
      channel metadata as spreadsheets


  - **Chef authors** can read the remainder of this README, and get started using
    the `ricecooker` library by following these first steps:
      - [Quickstart](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quickstart.ipynb), which will introduce you to
        the steps needed to create a sushi chef script.
      - After the quickstart, you should be ready to take things into your own
        hands, and complete all steps in the [ricecooker tutorial](https://gist.github.com/jayoshih/6678546d2a2fa3e7f04fc9090d81aff6).
      - The next step after that is to read the [ricecooker usage docs](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/usage.md),
        which is also available Jupyter notebooks under [docs/tutorial/](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/tutorial/).

  - **Ricecooker developers** should read all the documentation for chef authors,
    and also consult the docs in the [developer/](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/developer) folder for
    additional information info about the "behind the scenes" work needed to
    support the Kolibri content pipeline:
    - [Running chef scripts](chefops.md), also known as **chefops**.
    - [Running chef scripts in daemon mode](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/developer/daemonization.md)
    - [Managing the content pipeline](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/developer/sushops.md), also known as **sushops**.



## Installation

We'll assume you have a Python 3 installation on your computer and are familiar
with best practices for working with Python codes (e.g. `virtualenv` or `pipenv`).
If this is not the case, you can consult the Kolibri developer docs as a guide for
[setting up a Python virtualenv](http://kolibri-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/getting_started.html#virtual-environment).

The `ricecooker` library is a standard Python library distributed through PyPI:
  - Run `pip install ricecooker` to install
    You can then use `import ricecooker` in your chef script.
  - Some of functions in `ricecooker.utils` require additional software:
     - Make sure you install the command line tool [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
     - Running javascript code while scraping webpages requires the phantomJS browser.
       You can run `npm install phantomjs-prebuilt` in your chef's working directory.

For more details and install options, see [docs/installation.md](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/installation.md).



## Simple chef example

This is a sushi chef script that uses the `ricecooker` library to create a Kolibri
channel with a single topic node (Folder), and puts a single PDF content node inside that folder.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
from ricecooker.chefs import SushiChef
from ricecooker.classes.nodes import ChannelNode, TopicNode, DocumentNode
from ricecooker.classes.files import DocumentFile
from ricecooker.classes.licenses import get_license


class SimpleChef(SushiChef):
    channel_info = {
        'CHANNEL_TITLE': 'Potatoes info channel',
        'CHANNEL_SOURCE_DOMAIN': '<domain.org>',         # where you got the content (change me!!)
        'CHANNEL_SOURCE_ID': '<unique id for channel>',  # channel's unique id (change me!!)
        'CHANNEL_LANGUAGE': 'en',                        # le_utils language code
        'CHANNEL_THUMBNAIL': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/A_Grande_Batata.jpg', # (optional)
        'CHANNEL_DESCRIPTION': 'What is this channel about?',      # (optional)
    }

    def construct_channel(self, **kwargs):
        channel = self.get_channel(**kwargs)
        potato_topic = TopicNode(title="Potatoes!", source_id="<potatos_id>")
        channel.add_child(potato_topic)
        doc_node = DocumentNode(
            title='Growing potatoes',
            description='An article about growing potatoes on your rooftop.',
            source_id='pubs/mafri-potatoe',
            license=get_license('CC BY', copyright_holder='University of Alberta'),
            language='en',
            files=[DocumentFile(path='https://www.gov.mb.ca/inr/pdf/pubs/mafri-potatoe.pdf',
                                language='en')],
        )
        potato_topic.add_child(doc_node)
        return channel


if __name__ == '__main__':
    """
    Run this script on the command line using:
        python simple_chef.py -v --reset --token=YOURTOKENHERE9139139f3a23232
    """
    simple_chef = SimpleChef()
    simple_chef.main()
```

Let's assume the above code snippet is saved as the file `simple_chef.py`.

You can run the chef script by passing the appropriate command line arguments:

    python simple_chef.py -v --reset --token=YOURTOKENHERE9139139f3a23232

The most important argument when running a chef script is `--token` which is used
to pass in the Studio Access Token which you can obtain from your profile's
[settings page](http://studio.learningequality.org/settings/tokens).

The flags `-v` (verbose) and `--reset` are generally useful in development.
These make sure the chef script will start the process from scratch and displays
useful debugging information on the command line.

To see all the `ricecooker` command line options, run `python simple_chef.py -h`.
For more details about running chef scripts see [the chefops page](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/docs/chefops.md).

If you get an error when running the chef, make sure you've replaced
`YOURTOKENHERE9139139f3a23232` by the token you obtained from Studio.
Also make sure you've changed the value of `channel_info['CHANNEL_SOURCE_DOMAIN']`
and `channel_info['CHANNEL_SOURCE_ID']` instead of using the default values.
