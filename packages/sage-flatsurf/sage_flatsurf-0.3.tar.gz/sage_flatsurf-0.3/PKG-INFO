Description: sage-flatsurf
        =============
        
        This is a software package for working with flat surfaces in
        `SageMath`_. The flatsurf documentation
        is available at http://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/flatsurf/latest/
        
        We aim for this package to support the investigation of geometric, algebraic and
        dynamical questions related to flat surfaces. By flat surface we mean a surface
        modeled on the plane with monodromy given by similarities of the plane, though
        current efforts are focused on translation surfaces and half-translation
        surfaces.
        
        Currently, the package can generate images of flat surfaces, plot straight-line
        trajectories, deform surfaces through the SL(2,R) action, and compute Delaunay
        decompositions. `SageMath`_ is used to perform exact arithmetic.
        
        This package is open source software, released under GPL v2 (see the ``COPYING``
        file). We welcome any help to improve the package and especially to broaden
        the package's mathematical abilities.
        
        The package is currently in active development. If you would like assistance
        in using it, please contact the authors.

        Installing the dependency
        -------------------------
        
        Our software depends on the `surface-dynamics`_ package,
        which is distributed on PyPI. To install it, run the
        following command::
        
            $ sage -pip install surface_dynamics [--user]
        
        The --user option is optional and allows to install the corresponding
        Python module in your user space rather than system-wide (and thus
        does not require administrator rights).
        
        Installing the package
        ----------------------
        
        Since sage-flatsurf is available on PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/sage-flatsurf/,
        the released version of sage-flatsurf can be installed by running the following command::
        
            $ sage -pip install sage-flatsurf [--user] [--upgrade]
        
        To install the development version of sage-flatsurf, run instead::
        
            $ sage -pip install git+https://github.com/videlec/sage-flatsurf [--user] [--upgrade]
        
        The options ``--user`` and ``--upgrade`` are optional. The option ``--user`` make
        the installation in your home directory instead of in the Sage sources. The
        option ``--upgrade`` allows you to upgrade if the package is already installed.
        
        This might fail if `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ is not installed on your
        computer (which could happen for example with certain versions of Sage in Windows).
        In this situation you have two options. Either you install Git. Or you download
        this project from the "Clone or download" drop-down menu above (you should get
        a zip file). Then you need to run the command::
        
            $ sage -pip install TARBALL_NAME [--user] [--upgrade]
        
        where ``TARBALL_NAME`` has to be replaced with the full path to your tarball.
        Under Windows, it should be a Cygwin path and will look something like
        ``/cygdrive/c/Users/You/Downloads/sage-flatsurf-master.zip``.
        
        Then you should be able to use the following within sage::
        
            sage: import flatsurf.geometry.similarity_surface_generators as sfg
            sage: T = sfg.translation_surfaces.regular_octagon()
            sage: T
            Translation surface built from 1 polygon
            sage: T.stratum()
            H_2(2)
        
        To uninstall the package, you can do::
        
            $ sage -pip uninstall flatsurf
        
        Run the tests
        -------------
        
        Running the tests of a specific file or directory is done by running::
        
            $ sage -t --force-lib ARG
        
        where ``ARG`` is either a directory or file. In particular, to test all the
        files in the module just do::
        
            $ sage -t --force-lib flatsurf
        
        Tests on the master branch are automatically run through
        `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/github/flatsurf/sage-flatsurf>`_

        ----------------
        
        There are several related projects
        
        * `surface-dynamics`_ (SageMath module): more focused on dynamics (interval
          exchanges)
        
        * `veerer`_ (Python module): specific to handle specific triangulation of
          half-translation surfaces
        
        * `flatsurf`_: (C++ library with Python interface) computing GL(2,R)-orbit
          closure of translation surfaces
