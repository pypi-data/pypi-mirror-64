Description: The PLIB.DBTOOLS package provides an easier to use interface
        to DB-API compliant databases.
        
        Note: PLIB.DBTOOLS works with Python 2.7. If you are using
        Python 3, see the PLIB3.DBTOOLS package, available at
        https://pypi.org/project/plib3.dbtools.
        
        The ``setup.py`` script for PLIB.DBTOOLS uses the ``setuputils``
        helper module, which helps to automate away much of the
        boilerplate in Python setup scripts. This module is available
        as a separate release at https://pypi.org/project/setuputils.
        
        The PLIB.DBTOOLS Package
        ------------------------
        
        The following classes and functions are available in the ``plib.dbtools``
        namespace:
        
        - The ``DBInterface`` class provides a simple API for working with
          databases. It assumes that the underlying database engine conforms
          to the Python DB API. This class itself does not know about any
          particular database engine; a customized class should be derived
          from it for each particular engine.
        
        - The ``MySQLDBInterface`` class customizes ``DBInterface`` to work
          with a MySQL database. It uses the ``MySQLdb`` third-party Python
          package. This class is in the ``plib.dbtools.mysql`` sub-package.
        
        - The ``SQLite3DBInterface`` class customizes ``DBInterface`` to work
          with an SQLite version 3 database. It uses the ``sqlite3`` module
          that comes with Python as its database engine. This class is in the
          ``plib.dbtools.sqlite`` sub-package.
        
        - The ``get_db_interface`` function is a convenience function that
          returns an instance of the appropriate ``DBInterface`` subclass for
          the database type passed to it.
        
        - The ``get_db_interface_class`` and ``get_db_interface_args`` functions
          factor out key portions of ``get_db_interface`` so that they can be
          used separately if desired. For example, some databases might require
          subclassing the interface class further, or customizing the interface
          arguments.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install PLIB.DBTOOLS, you can simply run::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        at a shell prompt from the directory into which you
        unzipped the source tarball (the same directory that this
        README file is in). This will install PLIB and then
        run each of the post-install scripts in the scripts
        directory.
