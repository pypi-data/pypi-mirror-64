Description: # Steganography with Python
        StegaPy is a simple Python library for dealing with basic steganographic algorithms.
        This library is exclusively educational, it carries only the goal of showing 
        that steganography is very interesting, especially if you  work with it 
        using Python programming language.
        
        ## Modes
        **1. StegaBmp**\
        This module helps you to encode text data in 24-bit BMP image.
        The idea is to take every byte of image and replace some smaller bits with
        your data. After this action image will look like original if you replace small amount
        of bits.
        
        **2. StegaTxt**\
        This module helps you to encode text data in another text file using letters 
        that look similar in both english and russian alphabets.\
        Encoded bit 1 - english letter is replaced with russian.\
        Encoded bit 0 - english letter is not replaced.
        
        **3. StegaWav**\
        This module helps you to encode text data in WAV audio file.
        The idea is to take every sample (2 bytes) from audio and replace some smaller bits with
        your data. After this action audio will look like original if you replace small amount
        of bits.
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        from stegapy.stegatxt import encode_text, decode_text
        import os
        
        
        text_file = "to_encode.txt"
        encode_text(text_file, "letters_source.txt", "encoded.txt")
        
        to_read = os.stat(text_file).st_size
        decode_text("encoded.txt", "decoded.txt", to_read)
        ```
