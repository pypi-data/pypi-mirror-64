# gtimeit
Timer, benchmark and ressource usage tracker.
A tool for python functions. Time and compare your functions inside or outside a program.

## Benchmark

Allows to run multiple python functions a certain amount of times and to compare there respective execution times.
Similar to [timeit](https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html) Display curves of all the execution times.
Prototype : benchmarking for complexity tests up to one variable parameter. The variable take all the values of a given range and the benchmarck keeps track of the executions times.

## Tracker
Allow to keep track of the execution time of some functions in a program. Useful to know which part of your program take the more time to execute.
