With the removal to configure a Cisco NGFW via the command line your only option is to
do so via a manager.  Some things are better when automated so using the manager's API gives us that power. 
However, the current way to write external scripts and interact with the FMC's API isn't that great.  We created 
this "wrapper" to give you an easier to use way of communicating with the FMC's API than using the example code 
provided in the API Explorer.
