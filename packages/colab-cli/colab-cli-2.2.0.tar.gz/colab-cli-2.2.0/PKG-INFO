### ‚ú® [Demo](https://github.com/Akshay090/colab-cli/demo)

## Install

```sh
python -m pip install colab-cli or python3.7 -m pip install colab-cli
```
## Set-up

STEP-1: 
 
 Get your client_secrets.json, [instructions given here](https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/quickstart.html),
only follow till the part where you have client_secrets.json in a local directory

STEP-2: 

 Go to the local directory with client_secrets.json
  ```sh
  colab-cli set-config client_secrets.json
  ```
STEP-3:
 
Now we need to set the google account user id, goto your browser and see how many google logins you have,
 the count start from zero
 
 for eg. I have 3 login and I use the second one for coding work, so my user id is 1
  ```sh
  colab-cli set-auth-user 1
  ```
 
üôå Now You're all set to go
## Usage

```sh
colab-cli --help
```
* List local ipynb
```sh
colab-cli list-nb
``` 
* Open local ipynb file in google colab for first time and remote copy for subsequent time
```sh
colab-cli open-nb lesson1-pets.ipynb
``` 
* Now you have made some changes to ipynb in colab, get the modified file locally by
```sh
colab-cli pull-nb lesson1-pets.ipynb
``` 
* Made some changes to ipynb locally, push it to drive
```sh
colab-cli push-nb lesson1-pets.ipynb
```
