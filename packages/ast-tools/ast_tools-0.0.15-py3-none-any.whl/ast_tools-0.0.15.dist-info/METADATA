Toolbox for working with the Python AST

```
pip install ast_tools
```

# Macros
## Loop Unrolling
Unroll loops using the pattern
```python
for <var> in ast_tools.macros.unroll(<iter>):
    ...
```

`<iter>` should be an iterable object that produces integers (e.g. `range(8)`)
that can be evaluated at definition time (can refer to variables in the scope
of the function definition)

For example, 
```python
from ast_tools.passes import begin_rewrite, loop_unroll, end_rewrite

@end_rewrite()
@loop_unroll()
@begin_rewrite()
def foo():
    for i in ast_tools.macros.unroll(range(8)):
        print(i)
```
is rewritten into
```python
def foo():
    print(0)
    print(1)
    print(2)
    print(3)
    print(4)
    print(5)
    print(6)
    print(7)
```

You can also use a list of `int`s, here's an example that also uses a reference
to a variable defined in the outer scope:
```python
from ast_tools.passes import begin_rewrite, loop_unroll, end_rewrite

j = [1, 2, 3]
@end_rewrite()
@loop_unroll()
@begin_rewrite()
def foo():
    for i in ast_tools.macros.unroll(j):
        print(i)
```
becomes
```python
def foo():
    print(1)
    print(2)
    print(3)
```
