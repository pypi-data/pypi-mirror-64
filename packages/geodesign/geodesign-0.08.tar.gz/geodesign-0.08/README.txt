Geosolution is a geospatial data science project, specifically build for creating spatial experimental design to ease the analysis of experimental block design.

  - You can design your experimental design in a quick and easy way
  - Checking spatial data consistency and handle large volume of data
  - Perform complex geometry solution and algorithm with preset condition

# New Features!

  - Import spatial data and and condition that apply for those specific requirements
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

And of course Geosolution itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
