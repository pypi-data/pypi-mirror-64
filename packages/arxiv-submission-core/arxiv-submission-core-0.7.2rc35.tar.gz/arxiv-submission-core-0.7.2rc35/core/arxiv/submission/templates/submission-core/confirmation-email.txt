We have received your submission to arXiv.

Your temporary submission identifier is: submit/{{ submission_id }}. You may
update your submission at: {{ url_for("submission",
submission_id=submission_id) }}.

Your article is scheduled to be announced at {{ announce_time.strftime("%a, %-d %b %Y %H:%M:%S ET") }}. The
abstract will appear in the subsequent mailing as displayed below, except that
the submission identifier will be replaced by the official arXiv identifier.
Updates before {{ freeze_time.strftime("%a, %-d %b %Y %H:%M:%S ET") }} will not delay announcement.

A paper password will be emailed to you when the article is announced. You
should share this with co-authors to allow them to claim ownership. If you have
a problem that you are not able to resolve through the web interface, contact
{{ config.SUPPORT_EMAIL }} with a description of the issue and reference the
submission identifier.
