    Group coherence algorithm. Calculates coherences for a single group, whose members each have
    a signal A and a signal B.

    :param fs: the sampling frequency of the signals

    :param max_surrogates: the maximum number of surrogates; this may be useful to reduce the time taken
                           to perform the calculation
    :param cleanup: whether to clean up the cache folder after completion
