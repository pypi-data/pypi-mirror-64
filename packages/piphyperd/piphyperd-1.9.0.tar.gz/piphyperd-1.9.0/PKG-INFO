        A simple python package to leverage pip programmatically.
        **piphyperd** is a wrapper around **pip**; it can provide features like automation or dependencies control within your workflows.
        
        ## About this package
        
        The reasons behind this package, in alternative to the standard `pip` (`import pip`) module, are in the attempt to expose a more stable interface, when programmatically installing or managing python packages, within pipelines or automation workflows.
        
        Although it is a **Python** module, and it is available via `import pip`, by design, **pip** is not supposed to be a library; every detail is subject to changes for any reason, from the import name itself to its API. It might be better to call the pip's internal APIs differently.
        
        ### Pitfalls
        
        When leveraging `pip` programmatically, there are also other topics worth considering:
        
        1. The pip code assumes that it is in sole control of the global state of the program;
        2. pip's code is not thread-safe. If you were to run pip in a thread;
        3. pip assumes that once it has finished its work, the process terminates.
        
        Furthermore, installing packages under the `sys.path` from a running Python process might result in unexpected or undesired behaviors.
        
        Taking everything into account, still might be necessary, or usefull, handling pip packages within code and automations, as much as possible in controlled manner. The most reliable way to do so, is leveraging pip in a `subprocess`:
        
        ```python
        # leverage subprocess.Popen to execute pip commands
        process = Popen(
            [sys.executable if self.python_path is None else self.python_path,
             "-m", "pip", command]
            + self.pip_options + self.packages + self.command_args, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
        ```
        
        For further information, continue reading from the source of this topic at the [the official pypa](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#using-pip-from-your-program) user guide.
        
        ## Install the package
        
        Refer to the official [project page](https://pypi.org/project/piphyperd/) for further information about the package status and releases.
        
        To install the latest version, run the following command in your terminal:
        
        ```bash
        pip install --user piphyperd
        ```
        
        ## API overview
        
        Once installed, you can import the package as follows `from piphyperd import PipHyperd`.
        The module is wrapping pip commands in methods, exposed through the object `PipHyperd`. You can initialize it by optionally passing pip commands extra options:
        
        ```python
        def __init__(self, *pip_options: Any, python_path: Optional[Path] = None):
            # Path to the python binary to use
            self.python_path: Optional[Path] = python_path
            # A list of pip packages to install || show || download || uninstall
            self.packages: List[str] = list()
            # pip command args, e.g.: pip download testpypi {command_args}
            self.command_args: List[str] = list()
            # pip options, e.g.: pip {pip_options} uninstall testpypi
            self.pip_options: List[str] = list(pip_options)
        # ...
        ```
        
        The API exposed conveniently wraps a set of pip commands that can help generating virtual environments, reports of the installed packages, outdated libraries. The `stdout` and `stderr` are returned by each method, allowing to store the output or to read it in a second instance.
        
        ### Object description
        
        To follow, a brief walkthrough through the methods exposed by the `PipHyperd` object.
        
        #### pip freeze
        
        Output installed pip packages in requirements format:
        
        ```python
        piphyperd.PipHyperd().freeze()
        ```
        
        #### pip list
        
        List installed pip packages.
        
        list_outdated -- True || False to list or not the outdated packages
        
        ```python
        piphyperd.PipHyperd("--verbose").list_packages() # the argument "--verbose" is of course optional
        
        # List outdated packages
        piphyperd.PipHyperd().list(True)
        ```
        
        #### pip show {{ package }}

        #### pip check
        
        Verify installed packages have compatible dependencies.
        
        ```python
        piphyperd.PipHyperd().check()
        ```
        
        #### pipdeptree
        
        Render installed packages with dependencies tree.
        
        ```python
        piphyperd.PipHyperd().dependencies_tree()
        ```
        
        #### pip install {{ packages }}
        
        Install pip packages.
        
        ```python
        piphyperd.PipHyperd("-U").install("ansible", "cryptography") # -U is of course optional, set here as example
        ```
        
        #### pip download {{ package }}
        
        Download pip packages.
        
        ```python
        piphyperd.PipHyperd("-U").download("ansible", "pip", "cryptography", destination="/your/path/here") # the destination argument is optional
        ```
        
        #### pip uninstall {{ packages }}
