ArcadePlus is an easy-to-learn Python library for creating 2D video games.
It is ideal for beginning programmers, or programmers who want to create
2D games without learning a complex framework.

ArcadePlus is built on top of Pyglet and OpenGL.

The ArcadePlus Python library is made by George Shao.
ArcadePlus was forked from Arcade, a Python library made by Paul Vincent Craven.
