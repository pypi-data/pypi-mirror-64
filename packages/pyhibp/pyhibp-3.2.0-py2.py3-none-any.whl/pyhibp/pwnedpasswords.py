    """
    Execute a search for a password via the k-anonymity model, checking for hashes which match a specified
    prefix instead of supplying the full hash to the Pwned Passwords API.

    Uses the first five characters of a SHA-1 hash to provide a list of hash suffixes along with the
    number of times that hash appears in the data set. In doing so, the API is not provided the information
    required to reconstruct the password (e.g., by brute-forcing the hash).

    Either ```password`` or ``sha1_hash`` must be specified. Only one parameter should be provided.

    The precedence of parameters is as follows:
    1) password - Used to compute the SHA-1 hash of the password.
    2) sha1_hash - The hash prefix (hash[0:5]) is passed to the HIBP API, and this function will check the returned list of
    hash suffixes to determine if a breached password was in the HIBP database.

    Note: Suffix searches, that is, to retrieve a list of hash suffixes by supplying a hash prefix, have moved to
    `suffix_search()` as of this release (v3.1.0). A compatability shim has been left for this release, but will be removed on the
    next major version release.

    :param password: The password to check. Will be converted to a SHA-1 string. `str` type.
    :param sha1_hash: A full SHA-1 hash. `str` type.
    :return: An Integer representing the number of times the password is in the data set; if not found,
    Integer zero (0) is returned.

    Returns a list of SHA-1 hash suffixes, consisting of the SHA-1 hash characters after position five,
    and the number of times that password hash was found in the HIBP database, colon separated.

    Leveraging the k-Anonymity model, a list of hashes matching a specified SHA-1 prefix are returned.
    From this list, the calling application may determine if a given password was breached by comparing
    the remainder of the SHA-1 hash against the returned results. As an example, for the hash prefix of
    '42042', the hash suffixes would be:
