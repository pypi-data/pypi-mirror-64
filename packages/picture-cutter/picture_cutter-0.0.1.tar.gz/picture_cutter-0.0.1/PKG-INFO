        It's probably editing the version in setup.py and then
        
        ```
        python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
        ```
        
        Should then be installable via `pip install picture_cutter`
