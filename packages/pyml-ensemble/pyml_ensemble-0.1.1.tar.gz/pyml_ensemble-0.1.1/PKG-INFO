Description: # Python Machine Learning Ensemble
        A library used to create and manage adaptable machine learning ensembles in Python.
        
        The ensemble is intended to use deep learning models as the models. However, rather than
        including these models with the package there are ANN and LSTM models in the provided
        examples (examples/models/). This was to remove the package's dependency on the
        tensorflow package since many ensembles can be created without this package. There are
        some other, smaller dependencies still to make the Ensemble usable out of the box.
        
        To view the examples and check out the more powerful models visit the project's
        [GitHub page](https://github.com/anthonymorast/pyml-ensemble/). For convenience,
