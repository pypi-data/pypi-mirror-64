cromosim
========

CROMOSIM is a Python Library for Crowd Motion Simulation.

The aim of this open source project is to make it possible to users to run
simulations based from several models (cellular automata, microscopic
simulations or using compartments), to test new configurations, and even
to investigate the possibility to program their own model in complex
geometry: do-it yourself !

This package proposes Python implementations of the numerical methods detailed
in the book “Crowds in equations: an introduction to the microscopic modeling
of crowds” by B. Maury (ENS Ulm & Univ. Paris-Sud) and S. Faure (CNRS), World
Scientific 2018, Advanced textbooks in mathematics.
