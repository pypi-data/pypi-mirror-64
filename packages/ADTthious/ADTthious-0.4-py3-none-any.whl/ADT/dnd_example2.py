def MouseInWidget(Widget,Event):
    """
    Figure out where the cursor is with respect to a widget.
    
    Both "Widget" and the widget which precipitated "Event" must be
        in the same root window for this routine to work.
        
    We call this routine as part of drawing a DraggedObject inside a
        TargetWidget, eg our Canvas. Since all the routines which need
        to draw a DraggedObject (dnd_motion and it's friends) receive
        an Event, and since an event object contain e.x and e.y values which say
        where the cursor is with respect to the widget you might wonder what all
        the fuss is about; why not just use e.x and e.y? Well it's never
        that simple. The event that gets passed to dnd_motion et al was an
        event against the InitiatingObject and hence what e.x and e.y say is 
        where the mouse is WITH RESPECT TO THE INITIATINGOBJECT. Since we want
        to know where the mouse is with respect to some other object, like the
        Canvas, e.x and e.y do us little good. You can find out where the cursor
        is with respect to the screen (w.winfo_pointerxy) and you can find out
        where it is with respect to an event's root window (e.*_root). So we
        have three locations for the cursor, none of which are what we want.
        Great. We solve this by using w.winfo_root* to find the upper left
        corner of "Widget" with respect to it's root window. Thus we now know
        where both "Widget" and the cursor (e.*_root) are with respect to their
        common root window (hence the restriction that they MUST share a root
        window). Subtracting the two gives us the position of the cursor within
        the widget. 
        
    Yes, yes, we could have said:
        return (Event.X_root-Widget.winfo_rootx(),Event.y_root-Widget.winfo_rooty())
    and done it all on one line, but this is DEMO code and the three line version
    below makes it rather more obvious what's going on.

    x = Event.x_root - Widget.winfo_rootx()
    y = Event.y_root - Widget.winfo_rooty()
    return (x,y)

        User has clicked on a label representing us. Initiate drag and drop.
        There is a problem, er, opportunity here. In this case we would like to
            act as both the InitiationObject (because the user clicked on us
            and it't up to us to start the drag and drop) but we also want to
            act as the dragged object (because it's us the user wants to drag
            around). If we simply pass ourself to "Tkdnd" as the dragged object
            it won't work because the entire drag and drop process is moved
            along by <motion> events as a result of a binding by the widget
            on which the user clicked. That widget is the label which represents
            us and it get moved around by our "move" method. It also gets
            DELETED by our "vanish" method if the user moves it off the current
            canvas, which is a perfectly legal thing from them to do. If the
            widget which is driving the process gets deleted, the whole drag and
            drop grinds to a real quick halt. We use a little sleight of hand to
            get around this:
            1) From the label which is currently representing us (self.Label) 
               we take the text and save it in self.OriginalText. This will allow 
               us to resurrect the label at a later time if so desired. (It turns 
               out we so desire if the user tries to drop us in the middle of 
               nowhere, but that's a different story; see "dnd_end", above).
            2) We take the label which is currently representing us (self.Label)
               and we make it into an invisible phantom by setting its text to ''
               and settings its relief to FLAT. It is now, so to speak, a polar
               bear in a snowstorm. It's still there, but it blends in with the
               rest of then canvas on which it sits. 
            3) We move all the information about the phantom label (Canvas, ID
               and Label) into variables which store information about the 
               previous label (PreviousCanvas, PreviousID and PreviousLabel)
            4) We set self.Canvas and friends to None, which indicates that we 
               don't have a label representing us on the canvas. This is a bit
               of a lie (the phantom is technically on the canvas) but it does no
               harm.
            5) We call "self.Appear" which, noting that don't have a label
               representing us on the canvas, promptly draws one for us, which
               gets saved as self.Canvas etc.
            We went to all this trouble so that:
            a) The original widget on which the user clicked (now the phantom)
               could hang around driving the drag and drop until it is done, and
            b) The user has a label (the one just created by Appear) which they 
               can drag around, from canvas to canvas as desired, until they 
               drop it. THIS one can get deleted from the current canvas and
               redrawn on another canvas without Anything Bad happening.           
            From the users viewpoint the whole thing is seamless: they think
                the ARE dragging around the original label, but they are not. To 
                make it really clear what is happening, go to the top of the
                code and set "LeavePhantomVisible" to 1. Then when you drag an 
                existing object, you will see the phantom.
            The phantom is resolved by routine "dnd_end" above. If the user 
                drops us on a canvas, then we take up residence on the canvas and
                the phantom label, no longer needed, is deleted. If the user tries
                to drop us in the middle of nowhere, then there will be no
                'current' label for us (because we are in the middle of nowhere)
                and thus we resurrect the phantom label which in this case
                continues to represent us.    
            Note that this whole deal happens ONLY when the user clicks on an
                EXISTING instance of us. In the case where the user clicks over
                the button marked "InitiationObject" then it it that button that
                IS the initiation object, it creates a copy of us and the whole
                opportunity never happens, since the "InitiationObject" button 
                is never in any danger of being deleted.
