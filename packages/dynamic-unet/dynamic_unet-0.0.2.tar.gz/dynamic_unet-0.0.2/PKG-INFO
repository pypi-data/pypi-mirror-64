Description: # Dynamic U-Nets with PyTorch
        > This package has some convenience functions for setting up U-Nets with pre-trained ResNets as the encoder.
        
        
        ## Install
        
        `pip install dynamic_unet`
        
        ## Later
        * Examples of how to use this package
        * Add-ons for having arbitrary image classification networks being used as encoders, not just ResNets (which are limited to 3 channel inputs, and need some ad-hoc work to set up as encoders)
