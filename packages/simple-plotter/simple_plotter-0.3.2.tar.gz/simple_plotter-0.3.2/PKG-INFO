        simple-plotter
        ==============
        
        simple_plotter is a code-generator and minimal GUI frontend for plotting functional 2D x,y-plots.
        The function equation has to be entered in python syntax (allowing the use of numpy statements).
        
        Besides saving and loading projects to/from a JSON file, simple_plotter also provides the possibility to export the
        project as python code.
        
        The *simple_plotter* package comes with a Qt-based GUI-frontend. There is an additional alternative kivy-based frontend,
        created primarily for the Android port - simple-plotter4a_ - which can also be used on the desktop.

        Getting started
        ===============
        
        Desktop
        -------
        
        As *simple_plotter* is entirely written in python it should run on any desktop platform with a python3
        interpreter and support for the required packages (see `Requirements`_).
        
        The packages for *simple-plotter* are available on PyPI. The easiest solution is to install the base package with the
        default GUI front-end and plotting library (i.e. PyQt and matplotlib) using *pip*.
        
        Open up a terminal and type:
        
        ::
        
            pip install simple-plotter[Qt-matplotlib]
        
        It will automatically install the requirements.
        
        To launch simple-plotter just enter:
        
        ::
        
            simple-plotter
        
        To install different GUI/plotting library options see `Configuration options`_.
        
        
        Android
        -------
        
        The Android app is available in the F-Droid_ app-store.
        
        If you would like to build the Android APK from source follow the instructions
        on https://gitlab.com/thecker/simple-plotter4a
        
        .. note::
        
            Due to a broken matplotlib recipe in the *python-for-android* project only the *kivy-garden-graph* configuration is
            working on Android - see `Configuration options`_.
        
        
        Configuration options
        ---------------------
        
        The table below shows the currently available configuration options.
        
        +---------------------------+------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------------------+
        |                           |              plotting library      |  GUI frame work  |                               |
        +---------------------------+--------------+---------------------+---------+--------+-------------------------------+
        |       Configuration       |  matplotlib  |  garden.graph       |   PyQt  |  kivy  |     Package                   |
        +===========================+==============+=====================+=========+========+===============================+
        |     Qt-matplotlib         |      x       |                     |    x    |        | simple-plotter                |
        +---------------------------+--------------+---------------------+---------+--------+-------------------------------+
        |     kivy-matplotlib       |      x       |                     |         |   x    | simple-plotter4a              |
        +---------------------------+--------------+---------------------+---------+--------+-------------------------------+
        |     kivy-garden-graph     |              |          x          |         |   x    | simple-plotter4a              |
        +---------------------------+--------------+---------------------+---------+--------+-------------------------------+
        
        Use ``pip install <Package>[<Configuration>]`` to install one of the configuration options - e.g.:
        
        ::
        
            pip install simple-plotter4a[kivy-matplotlib]
        
        Similarly you launch the programs with ``simple-plotter-<Configuration>`` - e.g.:
        
        ::
        
            simple-plotter-kivy-matplotlib
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        *simple_plotter* is written in python3 and requires has following dependencies:
        
        Mandatory:
        
        * numpy
        * setuptools_scm
        * jinja2
        
        Optional:
        
        * pyqt >= 5
        * matplotlib>=2
        * kivy>=1.11
        * kivy-garden.graph>=0.4
        
        The optional dependencies provide are related to the different `Configuration options`_.
