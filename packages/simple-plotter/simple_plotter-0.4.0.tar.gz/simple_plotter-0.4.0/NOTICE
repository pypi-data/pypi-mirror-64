simple-plotter - plot code generator for 2D functional line graphs
Copyright (C) 2019-2020  Thies Hecker

simple-plotter 0.4.0 or later is released under the MIT license, while
earlier versions (up to 0.3.2) were mainly released under the GPLv3+ license
including some code in the advanced_graph module taken from matplotlib under
the matplotlib license.
In simple-plotter version 0.4.0 the Qt-frontend (simple_plotter/gui.py) as
well as the color map data in simple_plotter/core/advanced_graph.py taken
from matplotlib have been removed to allow for a simpler and more permissive
license of the core components.
The Qt-frontend is still available as a separate project called
'simple-plotter-qt', which remains released under the GPLv3+.
