Description: =======================
        celery_redis_prometheus
        =======================
        
        Exports task execution metrics in Prometheus format: how many tasks were started
        and have completed successfully or with failure, and how many tasks are still in
        the queues (supported only for broker redis).
        
        Inspired by https://gitlab.com/kalibrr/celery-prometheus
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Start HTTP service
        ------------------
        
        Start the HTTP server like this::
        
          $ bin/celery prometheus --host=127.0.0.1 --port=9691
        
        
        
        Configure Prometheus
        --------------------
        
        ::
        
            scrape_configs:
              - job_name: 'celery'
                static_configs:
                  - targets: ['localhost:9691']
        
        
        We export the following metrics:
        
        * ``celery_tasks_total{state="started|succeeded|failed|retried"}``, counter
        * ``celery_task_queuetime_seconds``, histogram (only if ``task_send_sent_event`` is enabled in Celery) 
        * ``celery_task_runtime_seconds``, histogram
        
        If you pass ``--queuelength-interval=x`` then every x seconds the queue lengths will be checked (NOTE: this only works with redis as the broker), resulting in this additional metric:
        
        * ``celery_queue_length{queue="..."}``, gauge
        
        
        Run tests
        =========
        
        Using `tox`_ and `py.test`_. Maybe install ``tox`` (e.g. via ``pip install tox``)
        and then simply run ``tox``.

        .. _`py.test`: http://pytest.org/
