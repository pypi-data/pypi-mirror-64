# WPWatcher
WordPress Watcher is a Python wrapper for [WPScan](http://wpscan.org/) that manages scans on multiple sites and reports by email

## In a Nutshell
  - Scan multiple sites with WPScan
  - Define reporting emails addresses for every configured site individually and globally
  - Mail messages are divided in "Warnings", "Alerts", "Informations" and eventually "Errors"
  - Mail notification and verbosity can be configred in config file, WPScan output can be attached to emails. 
  - Local log file can be configured and also lists all the findings 
  - Define false positives strings for every configured site individually and globally
  - Define WPScan arguments for every configured site individually and globally
  - Parse the results differently whether wpscan argument `--format` is `json` or `cli`

## Prerequisites 
  - [WPScan](http://wpscan.org/) (itself requires Ruby and some libraries).   
  - Python 3 (standard libraries)
#### Compatibility
Tested with WPScan 3.7 on :
- MacOS (WPScan install wil `HomeBrew`)
- Linux (WPScan installed with `RubyGems`)  

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tristanlatr/WPWatcher.git
cd WPWatcher && python3 setup.py install
```

#### Update
```bash
git pull && python3 setup.py install
```
#### Try it out

    wpwatcher --url exemple.com exemple1.com

The command should be in your `PATH` but you can always run the python script directly  

    python3 ./wpwatcher.py

### Configure
Create and edit a new config file from template.   (  `--template_conf` argument print a default config file  )

```bash
wpwatcher --template_conf > ./wpwatcher.conf
vim ./wpwatcher.conf
```
See *Configuration* bellow to learn more about options and how to and configure the script.    

#### Execute

    wpwatcher [--conf File path [File path ...]] [...]

`--conf` is the main argument, you can specify multiple files. Will overwrites the keys with each successive file.  
If not specified, it will try to load config from file `./wpwatcher.conf` and `~/wpwatcher.conf`.  

Other arguments will simply overwrite config values like `--url URL [URL ...]` or  `--verbose`.

See complete list of supported arguments in the sction *Command arguments* bellow.

#### Notes
- The script will automatically try to delete all temp `wpscan` files in `/tmp/wpscan` before starting scans
- You might want to use `--ff` (fail fast) when you're setting up and configuring the script. Abort scans when WPScan fails, useful to troubleshoot.
- All messages are printed to `stdout`.

#### Crontab
Add the following line to crontab to run WPWatcher every day and ignore errors.  

    0 0 * * * wpwatcher >/dev/null

If you want to receive email alerts with cron `MAILTO` feature.

    0 0 * * * wpwatcher --quiet

To print only ERRORS and WPScan ALERTS, use `--quiet` or set `quiet=Yes` in your config.

### Return non zero status code if :
- One or more WPScan command failed
- Unable to send one or more email report
- Other errors

## Configuration

The script **must read a configuration file to set mail server settings, WPScan path and arguments**. If no config file is found, mail server settings, WPScan path and arguments and other config values will have default values.  

Setup mail server settings and turn on `send_email_report` in the config file if you want to receive reports.  

All options can be missing from config file.

See *Command arguments* section below to see list of configurables values with CLI arguments and shortcuts. 

### Notes about WPScan API token

You need to register a WPVulDB account and use your API token with WPScan (`--api-token`) in order to show vulnerability data and be alerted of vulnerable WordPress or plugin. If no API token is provided to WPScan, scans will trigger WARNING emails with outdated plugin or WordPress version.

You can get a free API token with 50 daily requests. Scanning a site generates a undefined number of requests, it depends on the WPScan config and the number of WordPress plugins. WPScan will fail if you have no API calls in bank anymore. 

If you have large number of sites to watch, you'll probably can't scan all your sites with 50 requests. You can create multiple configuration files and schedule scans on several days. 
- `wpwatcher.conf`: contains all configurations except `wp_wites`
- `wp_sites_1.conf`: contains first X sites
- `wp_sites_2.conf`: contain the rest  ...  

In your crontab, configure script to run at your convenience. For exemple, with two lists :
```
# Will only run on odd days:
0 0 1-31/2 * * wpwatcher --conf wpwatcher.conf wp_sites_1.conf --quiet
# Will only run on even days:
0 0 2-30/2 * * wpwatcher --conf wpwatcher.conf wp_sites_2.conf --quiet
```

#### Save API Token in a file
You can store the API Token in the WPScan default config file at `~/.wpscan/scan.yml` and not supply it via the wpscan CLI argument in the WPWatcher config file. See [WPSacn readme](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan#save-api-token-in-a-file).

### Basic usage with mail report

Simple configuration file without SMTP authentication 

```ini
[wpwatcher]
wpscan_path=wpscan
wp_sites=   [ {"url":"exemple.com"},
              {"url":"exemple2.com"}  ]
wpscan_args=[   "--format", "json",
                "--no-banner",
                "--random-user-agent", 
                "--disable-tls-checks",
                "--api-token", "YOUR_API_TOKEN" ]
send_email_report=Yes
email_to=["me@exemple.com"]
smtp_server=mailserver.exemple.com:25
from_email=WordPressWatcher@exemple.com
```

### Full configuration options

All configuration options with explanatory comments.

## Email reports

One report is generated per site and the reports are sent individually when finished scanning a website.

Email notification can have 4 status: 
- `ALERT`: You have a vulnerable Wordpress, theme or plugin
- `WARNING`: You have an oudated Wordpress, theme or plugin
- `INFO`: WPScan did not find any issues with your site
- `ERROR`: WPScan failed

![WPWatcher Report List](/screens/wpwatcher-report-list.png "WPWatcher Report")


Tip: set `"--format","json"` in  `wpscan_args` config option to use the json parsing feature. 

`wpwatcher` will use the `wpscan_parser.py` to parse WPScan output messages. Alerts, Warnings and Infos might differ whether you're using cli or json format.

## Output

Log file and stdout outputs are easily grepable with the following log levels and keywords:
  - `CRITICAL`: Only used for `WPScan ALERT`
  - `ERROR`:  WPScan failed, send report failed or other errors
  - `WARNING`: Only used for `WPScan WARNING`
  - `INFO`: Used for info output and `WPScan INFO`
  - `DEBUG`: Used for debug outup and raw WPScan output. 

In addition to log messages, the readable report, same as email report, is printed to stdout.
