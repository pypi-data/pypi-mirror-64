# DMC
A radio interferometric modeling tool developed for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).  The framework employed here utilizes PyMC3 for sampling and the eht-imaging library for VLBI data manipulation.

NOTE: Currently still in testing mode, so no guarantees that code will work at all yet.

### Installation instructions
Clone the repository, move into the main directory, and install using `pip`:

pip install .
```
