Description: # DMC
        A radio interferometric modeling tool developed for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).  The framework employed here utilizes PyMC3 for sampling and the eht-imaging library for VLBI data manipulation.
        
        NOTE: Currently still in testing mode, so no guarantees that code will work at all yet.
