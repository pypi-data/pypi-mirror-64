Description: 
        ## Introduction
        
        `garnets` is a very simple wrapper over the
        [garnett](https://github.com/glotzerlab/garnett) package. In version
        0.7, the API of garnett changed to rename some frame attributes
        (positions, orientations, velocities) to their singular
        form.
        
        ## Usage
        
        `garnets` is mostly designed to be a drop-in replacement for the
        garnett import at the top of your file:
        
        ```
        import garnets as garnett
        ```
        
        ## Caveats
        
        At the moment, only a basic compatibility layer is supported. Writing
        trajectories using frame objects that fulfill only the old frame API
        will not work, but writing frames that are read from a `garnets` or
        `garnett` trajectory should work.
