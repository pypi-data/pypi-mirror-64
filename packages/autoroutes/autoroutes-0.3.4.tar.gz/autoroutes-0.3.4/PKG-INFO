Description: # Autoroutes
        
        Routes for speed.
        
        
        ## Install
        
            pip install autoroutes
        
        
        ## API
        
        ```python
        # Create a Routes instance
        from autoroutes import Routes
        routes = Routes()
        
        # Register a new route
        routes.add('path/to/resource/{id}', something='value', anything='else')
        
        # Try to match a route
        routes.match('path/to/resource/1234')
        > ({'something': 'value', 'anything': 'else'}, {'id': '1234'})
        ```
        
        ### Placeholders
        
        Placeholders are defined by a curly brace pair: `path/{var}`. By default, this
        will match any character but the slash ('/').
        
        It's possible to control the placeholder type, either by:
        - using a named type: `alnum`, `digit`, `alpha`, `path` (matches everything),
          `any` (matches everything, including empty string), `string` (default):
        
                path/to/{var:digit}
                path/to/{var:string}  # Same as path/to/{var}
        
        - using a normal regex (slower; also note that regex containing curly braces is
          not yet supported)
        
                path/to/{var:\d\d\d}
        
        Placeholders can appear anywhere in the path
        
            path/to/file.{ext}
            path/to/{name}.{ext}
        
        
        ## Building from source
        
            pip install cython
            make compile
            python setup.py develop
        
        
        ## Tests
        
            make test

        ## Acknowledgements
        
        This package has been first made as a Cython port of the [R3](https://github.com/c9s/r3/)
        C router.
        See also [python-r3](https://framagit.org/ybon/python-r3), which was a first
        attempt to wrap R3. I was unhappy with the stability, and more curious about
        Cython, so I tried to make a first POC port, and was happy with it.
