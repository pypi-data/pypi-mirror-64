        Http Interface over Django ORM
        
        This library provides a simple HTTP interface over the Django ORM:
        
        It proveds the following endpoints:
        
        1.  https://your.server.com/orm/schema/module/[APP_NAME]
        
        This returns a list of all the Django DB Models in APP_NAME
        
        2.  https://your.server.com/orm/schema/[FULL_MODEL_NAME]
        
        This returns schema information about FULL_MODEL_NAME
        
        3.  https://your.server.com/orm/query/[FULL_MODEL_NAME]?email=[PARAMETER]&name=[PARAMETER]
        
        This performs a search for FULL_MODEL_NAME filtering by "email" and "name"
        
        4. PUT https://your.server.com/orm/query/[FULL_MODEL_NAME]/[ID] -d '{"first_name": "randi"}'
        
        This performs an update on the Model instance with "ID" and updates "first_name" to "randi"
        
        5. DELETE https://your.server.com/orm/query/[FULL_MODEL_NAME]/[id]
        
        This performa s delete
        
        6.  POST https://your.server.com/orm/query/[FULL_MODEL_NAME] - d '{"first_name" ...}'
