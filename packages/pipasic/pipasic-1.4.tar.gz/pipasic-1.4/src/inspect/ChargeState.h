// Code to support charge state determination.  Our plan is:
// - Organize a 'training+test' directory of spectra, half charge 2 and half charge 3.  The directory should 
// include some QTOF results.
// - Use an API in ChargeState.c to write out a set of features for these spectra.  +1 means charge 3, in this case.
// - Use libsvm to train a support vector machine on these features
// - Use the resulting model to guess charge states if the charge is unlisted, or if the MultiCharge option is set.  We 
// use easy heuristics to detect +1 spectra, then use the svm to separate +2 and +3.  If confidence is low, still search
// both charge states.
