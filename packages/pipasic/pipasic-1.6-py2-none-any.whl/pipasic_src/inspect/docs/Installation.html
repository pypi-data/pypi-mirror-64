<h1>Installation</h1>
To install Inspect, first unzip the source distribution.  You may need to compile it:
<li> On Windows, use the included executable
inspect.exe.  You can build the source code on Windows using the makefile, or
the included Visual Studio project.
<li> On Linux, first install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/">expat</a>.  Then,
build Inspect using the included makefile.
<li> Macintosh is not officially supported.  Follow the instructions for Linux, they are likely to work.
<br><br>
Other things to do while you're installing:
<li> Inspect requires <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> (version 2.1 or later) in order
to run various analysis and utility scripts.
<li> (Optional) You may wish to
install the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library (PIL)</a>
for generation of simple spectrum images.
<li> (Optional) If the <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/">psyco</a>
library is installed, it is automatically loaded to speed up analysis scripts; this is entirely
optional.
<li> (Recommended) The Python numeric library (numpy) is required for some analysis scripts.
<li>The distribution includes some system tests.  After installing, go to the Inspect directory, and
run them to be sure that things are installed properly:<br>
<tt><b>python SystemTest.py</b></tt><br>
After the run completes, any errors will be reported.  Files used by the system tests are stored
in the "SystemTest" subdirectory.  The test input file "TestInput.txt" is annotated
with comments, and you can refer to it (or copy and modify it) when starting up searches.
<br><br>
If the tests fail, please <a href="mailto:spayne@ucsd.edu">submit a bug report</a> (and include
any relevant-looking error messages).
