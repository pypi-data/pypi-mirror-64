`hmf` is a python application that provides a flexible and simple way to calculate the 
Halo Mass Function for a range of varying parameters. It is also the backend to
`HMFcalc <http://hmf.icrar.org>`_, the online HMF calculator.

Version 3 Note
--------------
Due to the general trend of moving to Python 3 by important projects such as IPython and astropy, from
version 3.0, hmf is compatible with Python 3, and from version 3.1, it will drop (official) support for Python 2.
