"""This module contains functions for RETIS.

This module defines functions that are needed to perform Replica
Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS). The RETIS algorithm
was first described by van Erp [RETIS]_ and the stone skipping and
web throwing moves were first described by
Riccardi et al. [SS+WT-RETIS]_.


Methods defined here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

make_retis_step (:py:func:`.make_retis_step`)
    Function to select and execute the RETIS move.

retis_tis_moves (:py:func:`.retis_tis_moves`)
    Function to execute the TIS steps in the RETIS algorithm.

retis_moves (:py:func:`.retis_moves`)
    Function to perform RETIS swapping moves - it selects what scheme
    to use, i.e. ``[0^-] <-> [0^+], [1^+] <-> [2^+], ...`` or
    ``[0^+] <-> [1^+], [2^+] <-> [3^+], ...``.

retis_swap (:py:func:`.retis_swap`)
    The function that actually swaps two path ensembles.

retis_swap_zero (:py:func:`.retis_swap_zero`)
    The function that performs the swapping for the
    ``[0^-] <-> [0^+]`` swap.

high_acc_swap (:py:func:`.high_acc_wap`)
    The function coputes if a path generated via SS can be accepted
    for swapping in accordance to super detail balance.

    """Determine and execute the appropriate RETIS move.

    Here we will determine what kind of RETIS moves we should do.
    We have two options:

    1) Do the RETIS swapping moves. This is done by calling
       :py:func:`.retis_moves`.
    2) Do TIS moves, either for all ensembles or for just one, based on
       values of relative shoot frequencies. This is done by calling
       :py:func:`.retis_tis_moves`.

    This function will just determine and execute the appropriate move
    (1 or 2) based on the given swapping frequencies in the `settings`
    and drawing a random number from the random number generator `rgen`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ensembles : list of objects like :py:class:`.PathEnsemble`
        This is a list of the ensembles we are using in the RETIS method.
    order_function : object like :py:class:`.OrderParameter`
        The class used for calculating the order parameter(s).
    engine : object like :py:class:`.EngineBase`
        The engine to use for propagating a path.
    rgen : object like :py:class:`.RandomGenerator`
        This is a random generator. Here we assume that we can call
        `rgen.rand()` to draw random uniform numbers.
    settings : dict
        This dict contains the settings for the RETIS method.
    cycle : integer
        The current cycle number.

    Returns
    -------
    out : list of lists
        `out[i]` contains the result after performing the move for path
        ensemble no. `i`.

    This function will execute the TIS steps in the RETIS method. These
    differ slightly from the regular TIS moves since we have two options
    on how to perform them. These two options are controlled by the
    given settings:

    1) If `relative_shoots` is given in the input settings, then we will
       pick at random what ensemble we will perform TIS on. For all the
       other ensembles we again have two options based on the given
       `settings['nullmoves']`:

       a) Do a 'null move' in all other ensembles.
       b) Do nothing for all other ensembles.

       Performing the null move in an ensemble will simply just accept

    First we have two strategies based on

def retis_swap_zero(ensembles, order_function, engine,
                    settings, cycle):
    """Perform the RETIS swapping for ``[0^-] <-> [0^+]`` swaps.

    The RETIS swapping move for ensembles [0^-] and [0^+] requires some
    extra integration. Here we are generating new paths for [0^-] and
    [0^+] in the following way:

    1) For [0^-] we take the initial point in [0^+] and integrate
       backward in time. This is merged with the second point in [0^+]
       to give the final path. The initial point in [0^+] starts to the
       left of the interface and the second point is on the right
       side - i.e. the path will cross the interface at the end points.
       If we let the last point in [0^+] be called ``A_0`` and the
       second last point ``B``, and we let ``A_1, A_2, ...`` be the
       points on the backward trajectory generated from ``A_0`` then
       the final path will be made up of the points
       ``[..., A_2, A_1, A_0, B]``. Here, ``B`` will be on the right
       side of the interface and the first point of the path will also
       be on the right side.

    2) For [0^+] we take the last point of [0^-] and use that as an
       initial point to generate a new trajectory for [0^+] by
       integration forward in time. We also include the second last
       point of the [0^-] trajectory which is on the left side of the
       interface. We let the second last point be ``B`` (this is on the
       left side of the interface), the last point ``A_0`` and the
       points generated from ``A_0`` we denote by ``A_1, A_2, ...``.
       Then the resulting path will be ``[B, A_0, A_1, A_2, ...]``.
       Here, ``B`` will be on the left side of the interface and the
       last point of the path will also be on the left side of the
       interface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ensembles : list of objects like :py:class:`.PathEnsemble`
        This is a list of the ensembles we are using in the RETIS method.
    order_function : object like :py:class:`.OrderParameter`
        The class used for calculating the order parameter(s).
    engine : object like :py:class:`.EngineBase`
        The engine to use for propagating a path.
    settings : dict
        This dict contains the settings for the RETIS method.
    cycle : integer
        The current cycle number.

    Returns
    -------
    out : string
        The result of the swapping move.
