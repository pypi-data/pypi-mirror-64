TIS analysis report generated by @{{ program }}@ version @{{ version }}@
on @{{ date }}@.

Please note that the flux (and thus the rate constant)
was **not** calculated in this analysis!

The main result is:

* The crossing probability:
  :math:`P_{\text{cross}} = @{{ numbers['pcross'] }}@  \pm  @{{ numbers['perr'] }}@ \%`

Detailed results are given below for the different path
ensembles and the overall results are summarized
in the `Combined results`_.

.. _figure-results:

Results for path ensembles
==========================

The following interfaces were used in the simulation and in
the analysis:

@{{ tables['interfaces'] }}@

The calculated crossing probabilities are:

@{{ tables['probability'] }}@

The crossing probabilities are also displayed in the figures below

Distributions for path lengths and shooting moves
-------------------------------------------------

The average path lengths in the different ensembles are given in
the table below and some distributions for the path lengths and
shooting moves can also be found here:

Combined results
================

The overall matched probability distributions are shown in the left figure
while the matched probability distribution is shown in the right figure below.
The overall crossing probability as a function of cycles
and its relative error block analysis are reported in the two following
plots, respectively.

The overall crossing probability is:
:math:`P_{\text{cross}} = @{{ numbers['pcross'] }}@  \pm  @{{ numbers['perr'] }}@ \%`

Other statistics:

* :math:`\text{sim.time} = @{{ numbers['simt'] }}@`

* :math:`\tau_{\text{eff}}^{\text{opt}} = @{{ numbers['opteff']}}@`
