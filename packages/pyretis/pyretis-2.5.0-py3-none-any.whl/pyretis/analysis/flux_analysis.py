    settings : dict
        This dict contains the settings for the analysis. Note that

    Parameters
    ----------
    fluxdata : list of tuples of ints

        simulation.
    nint : int
        The number of interfaces used.
    end_step : int
        This is the last step done in the simulation.

    Returns
    -------
    eff_cross : list of lists
        `eff_cross[i]` is the effective crossings times for
        interface `i`.
    ncross : list of ints
        `ncross[i]` is the number of crossings for interface `i`.
    neffcross : list of ints

    Note
    ----
    We do here `intf - 1`. This is just to be compatible with the old
    FORTRAN code where the interfaces are numbered 1, 2, 3 rather than
    0, 1, 2. If this is to be changed in the future the `-1` can just
    be removed. Such a change will also require changes to the
    formatter for flux data.
