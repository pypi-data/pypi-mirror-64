Important methods defined here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

generate_initial_path_kick (:py:func:`.generate_initial_path_kick`)
    Function for generating an initial path by repeatedly kicking a
    phase point.

initiate_kick (:py:func:`.initiate_kick`)
    Helper method, selects either :py:func:`.initiate_kicki` or
    :py:func:`.initiate_kick_max`.

initiate_kicki (:py:func:`.initiate_kicki`)
    A method for initiating a path ensemble by repeatedly modifying
    velocities to find the crossing with the interfaces.

initiate_kick_max (:py:func:`.initiate_kick_max`)
    A method similar to py:meth:`.initiate_kick`. Here, if possible,
    we will use points from the previous paths, closest to the target
    interface.

initiate_path_ensemble_kick (:py:func:`.initiate_path_ensemble_kick`)
    Method to initiate a single path ensemble.

fix_path_by_tis (:py:func:`.fix_path_by_tis`)
    Method to fix an initial path that starts and ends at the wrong
    interface via TIS moves.

    forward and backward in time. This function is intended for use with
