PyRETIS documentation
---------------------

The documentation for PyRETIS is available either doc-strings provided
with the code and from `the PyRETIS homepage <http://www.pyretis.org>`_.

PyRETIS sub-packages
--------------------

analysis (:py:mod:`pyretis.analysis`)
    Analysis tools for calculating crossing probabilities, rates etc.

core (py:mod:`pyretis.core`)
    Core classes and functions for running the rare event simulations.
    This includes classes defining the system, particles, simulations
    etc.

engines (:py:mod:`pyretis.engines`)
    A package defining engines which can be used to
    evolve the dynamics/solve Newton's equations of motion in time.

forcefield (:py:mod:`pyretis.forcefield`)
    This package defines force fields and potentials functions.

inout (:py:mod:`pyretis.inout`)
    This package defines the input-output operations for PyRETIS.
    This includes generating output from the analysis and reading
    input-files etc.

orderparameter (:py:mod:`pyretis.orderparameter`)
    Definition of classes for order parameters. Defines the base class
    for order parameters.

testing (:py:mod:`pyretis.testing`)
    This package defines common methods which are used in testing.

tools (:py:mod:`pyretis.tools`)
    This package defines some functions which can be useful for
    setting up simple systems, for example, functions for generating
    lattices.
