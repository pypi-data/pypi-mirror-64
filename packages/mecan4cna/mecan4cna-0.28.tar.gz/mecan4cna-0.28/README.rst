Mecan4CNA
=========

A copy number profile usually needs to be calibrated for the position of
baseline (normal copy numbers) due to sample impurity and measurement
bias. It’s crucial to normalize CN profiles when comparing them in
analysis, because usually each profile has a different signal scale.

Mecan4CNA (Minimum Error Calibration and Normalization for Copy Number
Analysis) uses an algebraic method to estimate the baseline and the
distance between DNA levels (referred to as level distance). It can be
used for both single file analysis and multi-file normalization.

Key features:

-  Calibration of a segmentation file, so that the signal of normal is
   aligned to 2 (0 in log2)
-  Estimation of the distance between DNA levels
-  Normalizing multiple files to a uniformed signal scale, so that 3
   (0.585 in log2) and 1 (-1 in log2) actually correspond to one copy
   gain and one copy lost
-  Needs only a segmentation file (from any platform)
-  Detailed results and plots for in-depth analysis
-  Fast

How to install
--------------

The easiest way is to install through pip:

::

   pip install mecan4cna
   mecan4cna --help

How to use
----------

See the
`manual <https://github.com/baudisgroup/mecan4cna/blob/master/manual.md>`__
for details.

Quick start
~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   mecan4cna -i [SEGMENT_FILE] -o [OUTPUT_PATH]

Demo mode
~~~~~~~~~

::

   mecan4cna --demo

This will copy 5 example files to the current directory and run with
default settings. It invokes the ``run_mecan_example.sh`` script, which
will also be copied over and can be used as a template for customized
analysis.

     --help                          Show this message and exit.

Required options are:

-  ``-i FILENAME``
-  ``-o OUTPUTPATH``

Input file format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input should be a segmentation file:

-  have at least **5** columns：id, chromosome, start, end, probes and
   value (in exact order, names do not matter). Any additional columns
   will be ignored.
-  the first line of the file is assumed to be column names, and will be
   ignored. Do not put empty lines at the beginning of the file.
-  be **tab separated**, without quoted values

An example:

::

   id  chro    start   end num_probes  seg_mean
   GSM378022   1   775852  143752373   9992    0.025
   GSM378022   1   143782024   214220966   6381    0.1607
   GSM378022   2   88585000    144628991   4256    0.0131
   GSM378022   2   144635510   146290468   146 0.1432
   GSM378022   3   48603   8994748 1469    0.0544

Output files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

4 files will be created in the output path. If mecan fails to detect
anything (not enough aberrant segments or no valid models), only the
histogram will be created:

-  base_level.txt : contains the estimated baseline and level distance.
-  histogram.pdf : a visual illustration of signal distributions.
-  models.tsv : a tab separated table that details all information of
   all models.
-  peaks.tsv : a tab separated table shows the determined signal peaks
   and their relative DNA levels compared to the baseline.

Calibration and normalization
-----------------------------

With the ``-n`` flag, the input file will be normalized and saved as
``normalized.tsv``.

Import as a python library
--------------------------

.. code:: python

   import mecan.mecan4cna.algorithms as alg
   import mecan.mecan4cna.common as comm

   with open('examples\segment_example_1.tsv', 'r') as fin:
       segments = comm.file2list(fin)
   m = alg.mecan()
   r = m.run(segments)

Common problems
---------------

Error of matplotlib
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It seems there is a bug in the latest version (3.0.3) of matplotlib,
which may cause problems in OSX. Mecan uses an older verison of
matplotlib (2.0.2) to avoid this problem. If you need to use the latest
version and run into runtime problems, please check the following links.
