"""
Group sequences that share a unique molecular identifier (UMI, barcode)

Since the same barcode can sometimes be used by different sequences, the CDR3
sequence can further be used to distinguish sequences. You can choose between
using either a 'pseudo CDR3' sequence, which encompasses by default bases 80
to 61 counted from the 3' end. Or you can use the real CDR3 detected with a
regular expression.

If grouping by CDR3s is enabled, sequences with identical barcode and CDR3
must additionally have a similar length. If the length differs by more than
2 bp, they are put into different groups.

The barcode can be in the 5' end or the 3' end of the sequence.

Use --trim-g to remove initial runs of G at the 5' end (artifact from RACE protocol).
These are removed after the barcode is removed.

For all the found groups, one sequence is output to standard output (in FASTA
format). Which sequence that is depends on the group size:
- If the group consists of a single sequence, that sequence is output
- If the group consists of two sequences, one of them is picked randomly
- If the group has at least three sequences, a consensus is computed. The
  consensus is output if it contains no ambiguous bases. Otherwise, also here a
  random sequence is chosen.
"""
# NOTES
#
# - Different lengths of the initial G run cannot be used to distinguish sequences
#  since they can come from polymerase problems in homopolymers.
# - There are some indels in homopolymers (probably PCR problem)
# - There are also regular sequencing errors in the initial run of G nucleotides.
# - Some paired reads arenâ€™t correctly merged into single reads. They end up being
#   too long.
# - When grouping by barcode and pseudo CDR3, sequence lengths vary within groups.
#   However, this affects only ~1% of sequences, so it is not necessary to compute
#   a multiple alignment. Just taking the consensus will drown the incorrect
#   sequences, at least if the group size is large.
# - It does not hurt to reduce the minimimum number of sequences per group for
#   taking a consensus to 2, but it also does not help much (results in 0.5% more
#   sequences). (The consensus is only successful if both sequences are identical.)
#   However, since this is also a simple way to deal with exact duplicates, we do
#   it anyway and can then skip the separate duplicate removal step (VSEARCH).

# TODO
# - Use pandas.DataFrame
