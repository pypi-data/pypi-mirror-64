WebPMinifier is a small tool written in pure Python to minify WebP files by stripping out ancillary data, this is similar to the tool: [pngminifier][2] but it operates on WebP instead of PNG files. `VP8 `, `VP8L`, `VP8X`, `ANIM`, `ANMF`,
`ALPH` chunks escape this filter as these are essential for a
WebP file to work as intended.

Some included chunks which fall in extended format section are considered semi-optional because they play the role to make the WebP file function correctly. These are â€” `VP8X`, `ANIM`, `ANMF`, `ALPH`.

#### Installation
Python must be installed whose version should be over 3.5. On GNU/Linux systems pip not installed by default, make sure that PIP 3 is installed.

```sh
# replace: pip with pip3, if required.
pip install webpmin
```

---

```
usage: webpmin.__main__ [-h] [--include  | --exclude ] input output

...

positional arguments:
  input       Input file to read WebP data from
  output      Output file to write WebP data to

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --include   Include user-defined chunks separted with commas. If chunk
              names are over four bytes, latter ones are excluded. By default
              ANIM, ANMF, ALPH (semi essential chunks) will escape this filter.
  --exclude   Exclude user-defined chunks separte with commas.
              Still, essential chunks will escape this filter.
```

Some examples of using this tool:
```sh
$ webpmin in.webp out.webp

# Include embedded color profile and XMP data.
$ webpmin in.webp --include "ICCP,XMP " out.webp

# Exclude EXIF tags, syntax is same as --include.
$ webpmin in.webp --exclude "EXIF" out.webp
```
