This package provides statistical estimators to predict a population's total number of distinct values from a sample sequence - given a sample sequence of n values with only d distinct values, predict the total number of distinct values D that exists in the population N.

Sample use cases :

estimating the number of unique insects in a population from a field sample
estimating the number of unique words in a document given a sentence or a paragraph
estimating the number of unique items in a database from a few sample rows
