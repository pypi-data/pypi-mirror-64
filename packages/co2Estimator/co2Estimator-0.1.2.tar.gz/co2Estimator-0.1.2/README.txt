============
co2Estimator
============
A project started keeping in mind to make a PyPI package for co2 emission estimation.

Estimator and Estimation
========================
The estimator uses the data provided by [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle) and predict the co2 emitted by the vehicle based on vehicle-type(petrol or diesel) and distance travelled.

Support and Feedback
====================
I am open to ideas or any suggestions.
