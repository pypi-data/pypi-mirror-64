Description: ==========
        PhotoStats
        ==========
        
        This is a Python package that will eventually have a bunch of utilities for running a variety of stats on
        your photos based on EXIF data. By using exiv-based library, it can also read data
        from RAW files.
        
        Currently you can get lens stats by running:
        
        python -m photostats -p "path to photos"
        
        It will produce output like:
        
        Lens Model Count:
        
        EF17-40mm f/4L USM : 18
        
        EF28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 USM : 80
        
        Followed by a graph of the above data. Once you exit the graph window, you will get.
        
        Focal Length Count:
        
        17 mm : 14
        
        20 mm : 4
        
        63 mm : 5
        
        98 mm : 7
        
        70 mm : 41
        
        105 mm : 17
        
        28 mm : 3
        
        82 mm : 1
        
        65 mm : 4
        
        75 mm : 2
        
        Followed by another graph.
