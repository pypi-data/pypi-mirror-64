The following EBS volumes are not attached to an instance. Please consider deleting them to reduce cost and risks related to retaining old data.

If you are confident these unattached volumes should remain, you can tag the volumes as configured by your system administrator. The default tag is "probator:ignore"

{% for issue in issues %}
*Volume:* `{{ issue.volume_id }}`
*Account:* `{{ issue.account_id | account_name_from_id }}`
*Region:* `{{ issue.location }}`
*Notes:* {{ issue.notes | slack_quote_join }}

{% endfor %}
