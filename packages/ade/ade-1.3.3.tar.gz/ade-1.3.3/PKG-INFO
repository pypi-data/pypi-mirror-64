Description: 
        Performs the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm
        asynchronously. With a multiprocess evaluation function running on a
        multicore CPU or cluster, *ade* can get the DE processing done several
        times faster than standard single-threaded DE. It does this without
        departing in any way from the numeric operations performed by the
        classic Storn and Price algorithm. You can use either a randomly
        chosen candidate or the best available candidate.
        
        You get a substantial multiprocessing speed-up and the
        well-understood, time-tested behavior of the classic DE/rand/1/bin or
        DE/best/1/bin algorithm. (You can pick which one to use, or, thanks to
        a special *ade* feature, pick a probabilistic third version that
        effectively operates at a selected midpoint between the extremes of
        "random" and "best.") The underlying numeric recipe is not altered at
        all, but everything runs a lot faster.
        
        The *ade* package also does simple and smart population initialization,
        informative progress reporting, adaptation of the vector differential
        scaling factor *F* based on how much each generation is improving, and
        automatic termination after a reasonable level of convergence to the
        best solution.
        
        Comes with a couple of small and informative [example
        files](http://edsuom.com/ade/ade.examples.html), which you can install
        to an *ade-examples* subdirectory of your home directory by typing
        `ade-examples` as a shell command.
