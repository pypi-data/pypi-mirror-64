6. Calibration of double ended measurement with OLS
===================================================

A double ended calibration is performed with ordinary least squares.
Over all timesteps simultaneous. :math:`\gamma` and
:math:`\int_0^l\alpha`\ d\ :math:`x` remain constant, while :math:`C`
varies over time. The weights are considered equal here and no variance
is calculated.

Before starting the calibration procedure, the forward and the backward
channel should be aligned.

                Label of where to store D. Equals the integrated differential
                attenuation at x=0
                And should be equal to half the total integrated differential

            method : {'ols', 'wls', 'external'}
                Use 'ols' for ordinary least squares and 'wls' for weighted least
                squares
            solver : {'sparse', 'stats'}
                Either use the homemade weighted sparse solver or the weighted

                statsmodels
            transient_asym_att_x : iterable of float, optional
                Connectors cause assymetrical attenuation. Normal double ended
                calibration assumes symmetrical attenuation. An additional loss
                term is added in the 'shadow' of the forward and backward
                measurements. This loss term varies over time. Provide a list
                containing the x locations of the connectors along the fiber.
                Each location introduces an additional 2*nt parameters to solve
                for. Requiering either an additional calibration section or
                matching sections.
            fix_gamma : tuple
                A tuple containing two floats. The first float is the value of
                gamma, and the second item is the variance of the estimate of gamma.
                Covariances between gamma and other parameters are not accounted
                for.
            fix_alpha : tuple
                A tuple containing two arrays. The first array contains the
                values of integrated differential att (integral of Delta alpha
                between 0 and x in paper), and the second array
                contains the variance of the estimate of alpha.
                Covariances (in-) between alpha and other parameters are not
                accounted for.
            matching_sections : List[Tuple[slice, slice, bool]]
                Provide a list of tuples. A tuple per matching section. Each tuple
                has three items. The first two items are the slices of the sections
                that are matched. The third item is a boolean and is True if the two
                sections have a reverse direction ("J-configuration").
            matching_indices : array
                Provide an array of x-indices of size (npair, 2), where each pair
                has the same temperature. Used to improve the estimate of the
                integrated differential attenuation.
            verbose : bool
                Show additional calibration information

.. code:: ipython3

    ds100.calibration_double_ended(sections=sections,
                                   method='ols')

After calibration, two data variables are added to the ``DataStore``
object: - ``tmpf``, temperature calculated along the forward direction -
``tmpb``, temperature calculated along the backward direction

A better estimate, with a lower expected variance, of the temperature
along the fiber is the average of the two. We cannot weigh on more than
the other, as we do not have more information about the weighing.

.. code:: ipython3

    ds1 = ds100.isel(time=0)  # take only the first timestep
    
    ds1.tmpf.plot(linewidth=1, label='User cali. Forward', figsize=(12, 8))  # plot the temperature calibrated by us
    ds1.tmpb.plot(linewidth=1, label='User cali. Backward')  # plot the temperature calibrated by us
    ds1.tmp.plot(linewidth=1, label='Device calibrated')  # plot the temperature calibrated by the device
    plt.legend();

Lets compare our calibrated values with the device calibration. Lets
average the temperature of the forward channel and the backward channel
first.

.. code:: ipython3

    ds1['TMPAVG'] = (ds1.tmpf + ds1.tmpb) / 2
    ds1_diff = ds1.tmp - ds1.TMPAVG
    
    ds1_diff.plot(figsize=(12, 8));

The device calibration sections and calibration sections defined by us
differ. The device only allows for 2 sections, one per thermometer. And
most likely the :math:`\gamma` is fixed in the device calibration.
