    Changes the default value of ``docker_legacy_packages`` to ``false``.  This
    means that ``kolla-ansible bootstrap-servers`` will now configure the
    Docker CE repositories at https://download.docker.com, rather than the
    legacy Docker repositories at https://dockerproject.org. This is due to
    Docker removing access to the legacy repositories.
