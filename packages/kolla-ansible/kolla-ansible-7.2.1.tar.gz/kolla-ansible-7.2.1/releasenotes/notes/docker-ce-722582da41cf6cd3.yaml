    Adds support for installing Docker Community Edition (CE) using the
    ``kolla-ansible bootstrap-servers`` command.  Existing support uses the
    legacy packages from https://dockerproject.org.  New packages are
    distributed via https://download.docker.com, and that location is now
    supported and used by default.  Use of the new packages is enabled by
    setting the variable ``docker_legacy_packages`` to ``false``. New packages
    are enabled by default only for Ubuntu 18.04+, which does not support the
    legacy packages.

    It is also now possible to skip configuration of the Docker repository, by
    setting the variable ``enable_docker_repo`` to ``false``.

    The default value for ``docker_legacy_packages`` is ``true`` on all OS
    distributions except Ubuntu 18.04+. If this is set to ``false``, the Docker
    Community Edition (CE) will be installed. If the ``kolla-ansible
    bootstrap-servers`` command is used on a previously deployed host that is
    running a legacy Docker engine, it would result in the Docker engine being
    upgraded to use the Docker Community Edition packages, which will result in
    a restart of the Docker engine and the containers running on that host.
    Use the ``kolla-ansible`` ``--serial`` or ``--limit`` arguments to avoid
    losing quorum in clustered services such as MariaDB by restarting all
    containers at once.
