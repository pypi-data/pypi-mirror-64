petanque
========

petanque (and its Python binding pytanque) is a library that helps manipulate
symbolic boolean expressions.

For more information, see the Arybo project: http://pythonhosted.org/arybo/.

Quick start
===========

Under Windows/Linux/OSX, pytanque can be installed through pip for Python3:

.. code::

   $ pip install pytanque

You will need at least clang 3.5 or GCC 4.9 to compile the python extension
"pytanque" under Linux/OSX. You need at least Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 to
compile it under Windows.
