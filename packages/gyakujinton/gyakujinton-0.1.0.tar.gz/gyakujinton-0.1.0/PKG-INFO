# Gyaku Jinton

OpenCV wrapper to handle shapes and images.

## Pre-requisites

* Python 3.6.1 or higher
* OpenCV

I suggest to check OpenCV's [tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/df6/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_setup.htmlv) on installation to help you.

## Programmatic

### Drawing a polygon on image

Given an image path, by identifying points in the image, you can draw line based on given point.

If `color` is added as argument, it will also draw those lines by that color. The color is in RGB format.

If `output_path` is not defined, the application will create an application window with the modified image.

```python
from gyakujinton import draw_on_image
draw_on_image(
    image_path="/path/to/file.filetype",
    output_path="/path/to/output-file.filetype",  #optional
    points=[[INT, INT], ..., [INT, INT]],  # points on a 2D plane
    color=(0, 0, 0)  # in RGB; optional
)
```

## Command-line Interface

The application also allows executions through the CLI.

### Drawing a polygon on image (CLI)

The example below gets the image based on the path given and will draw a polygon based on the input points.

```bash
gyakujinton draw_on_image /path/to/file.filetype --points 100,100 200,100 200,200 100,200
```

We can also define an output path by adding the argument `-o` or `--output_path` followed by the file path.

```bash
gyakujinton draw_on_image /path/to/file.filetype --points 100,100 200,100 200,200 100,200 --output_path /path/to/output-file.filetype
```

## Name Inspiration

![Ohnoki's Dust Release](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/2/20/Dust_Release.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20150123214535)

> Source: naruto.fandom.com/wiki

When thinking of a name for the app, the first thing that came into mind is Ohnoki's [Particle Style (or Dust Release) Atomic Dismantling Jutsu](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Dust_Release:_Detachment_of_the_Primitive_World_Technique) from [Naruto](https://www.viz.com/naruto) which is a technique that has a sphere in the center contained by a geometric object. In the series, dust release is called `Jinton` which was chosen due to how amazed I am on the shapes happening.

Now, with the points above, the technique is used to dismantle atoms to dust. `Gyaku` (or reverse as taught to me by [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIICCEQFhAdEB46BQgAEIMBOgIIADoECAAQCjoFCAAQxAI6CAgAEBYQChAeOgYIABAWEB46BAghEApQ8ghYqDFgxjJoAnAAeACAAZ4BiAG7HpIBBDAuMzGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&uact=5&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&client=tw-ob#auto/ja/reverse)) was added to signifying making of shapes and images rather than dismantling them.

Hence, the app name `Gyaku Jinton`.
