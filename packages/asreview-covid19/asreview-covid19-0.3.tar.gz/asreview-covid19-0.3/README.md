# asreview-covid19

![ASReview for COVID19](https://github.com/asreview/asreview/blob/master/images/intro-covid19-small.png?raw=true)

Extension that adds Covid-19 related datasets to ASReview.

The CORD-19 machine learning dataset [dataset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) is available. A second dataset with a subset of the articles of CORD-19 published since December 2019 is relevant for the COVID-19 disease outbreak. 
Any suggestions for more datasets related to scientific literature on Covid-19 is welcome.

Install the extension with pip:

```bash
pip install asreview-covid19
```

The datasets will be available in the ASReview software.  

The extension will download the file from the internet for you, which depending on
your internet can take a while.
