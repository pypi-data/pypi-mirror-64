        Extension that adds Covid-19 related datasets to ASReview.
        
        The CORD-19 machine learning dataset [dataset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) is available. A second dataset with a subset of the articles of CORD-19 published since December 2019 is relevant for the COVID-19 disease outbreak. 
        Any suggestions for more datasets related to scientific literature on Covid-19 is welcome.
        
        Install the extension with pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install asreview-covid19
        ```
        
        The datasets will be available in the ASReview software.  
        
        The extension will download the file from the internet for you, which depending on
        your internet can take a while.
