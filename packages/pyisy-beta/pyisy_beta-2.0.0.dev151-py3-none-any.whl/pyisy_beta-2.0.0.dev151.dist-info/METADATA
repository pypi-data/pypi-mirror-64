## PyISY

### Python Library for the ISY Controller

This library allows for easy interaction with ISY nodes, programs, program,
climate module, and network module. This class also allows for functions to be
assigned as handlers when ISY parameters are changed. ISY parameters can be
monitored automatically as changes are reported from the device.

**NOTE:** Significant changes have been made in V2, please refer to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details. It is recommended you do not update  to the latest version without testing for any unknown breaking changes or impacts to your dependent code.


### Maintainers:

### PyISY_beta Fork & PyPi Package
