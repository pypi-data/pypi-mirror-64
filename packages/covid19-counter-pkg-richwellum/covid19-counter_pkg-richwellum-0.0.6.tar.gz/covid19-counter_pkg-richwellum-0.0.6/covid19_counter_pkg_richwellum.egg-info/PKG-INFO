Description: # covid19_counter
        
        Simple tool to display information about COVID19 and store and tweet out the
        details.
        
        Runs on a loop checking the number of Confirmed, Recovered and Deaths and also
        the percentage died.
        
        All data is pulled from: <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>
        
        User can specify the interval to check, the type of display (for small
        displays), and display the record of any changes. In addition there's a test
        option which allows you to enter your own data files, or make modifications.
        
        Data on Deaths, Confirmed cases, Recoveries and Percentage Died are calculated
        by pulling the CSV files down, and creating pandas df's, summing the data up
        ofthe last known column, which is also the latest.
        
        Option to Tweet the results - obviously requires a Twitter developer license
        and creds populated in an auth.py file.

        To install on a Mac directly from github clone:

        requests twython:
        
        ```bash
            brew install python3  #(or sudo apt install python3 etc)
            pip3 install pandas colorama termcolor requests twython
        ```
        
        Or install from pypi:
        
        ```bash
            pip3 install covid19-counter-pkg-richwellum==<version>
            covid19_counter
        ```
        
        Example running:
        
        ```bash
            RWELLUM-M-C5JH:covid19 rwellum$ covid19_counter -i 400 -h
            usage: covid19.py [-h] [-i INTERVAL] [-r] [-s] [-f] [-v] [-t]
        
            Grab and process the latest COVID-19 data
        
            optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            -i INTERVAL, --interval INTERVAL
                                    interval in seconds between retrieving the data again,
                                    default one hour(3600s)
            -r, --record          view a record of all changes
            -s, --split           split the display to fit smaller terminals
            -f, --force           bypass safety rails - very dangerous
            -v, --verbose         turn on verbose messages, commands and outputs
            -t, --test            run with a test file
