a) How does the charge Q depend on time t?
\(Q(t)=\)
%include('chcko/getorshow',idx=0)
<br>
The resistor, over which the capacity discharges, is R={{g.r}}\(k\Omega\).
At time t=0s we measure a voltage at the capacitor of {{g.u}}V, 
and at t={{g.t}}s the voltage is {{round(g.u2,2)}}V.
<br>
b) Find the capacity of the capacitor? \(\frac{C}{Î¼F}=\)
%include('chcko/getorshow',idx=1)
<br>
c) What is the charge at t=0s? \(\frac{Q_o}{As}=\)
%include('chcko/getorshow',idx=2)
<br>
d) What is the charge at t={{g.t}}s? \(\frac{Q_t}{As}=\)

e) After how many second is the fully loaded capacitor only half loaded?
