In the following use fractions for numbers.
<ol type="a">
<li>
If there is a linear price-sales function \(p(x)=kx+d\), how does
the marginal revenue look like \(E'(x)\) (use \(E(x)=xp(x)\)). 
</li><li>
Through market observations an upper price limit (intersection
between \(p(x)\) and p axis) is fixed at €{{ g.pmax }}. 
The saturation quantity (intersection between \(p(x)\) and the x axis) 
is estimated with {{ 2*g.xp0 }}.
One shall make a linear model for the marginal revenue
<br>\(E'(x)=\) 
%include('chcko/getorshow',idx = 0, show = util.tx(util.tex))
</li><li>
Through integration this marginal revenue one gets the total revenue.
<br>\(E(x) =\) 
%include('chcko/getorshow',idx = 1, show = util.tx(util.tex))
<br>
How do we determine the integration constant?
</li><li>
Costs consist of fixed costs and variable costs. 
Are the fixed costs independent from the production quantity and why? 
</li><li>
The marginal costs are assumed to be quadratic 
\(K'(x)= {{ util.tex(g.Kp) }} \).
Which model describes the total costs (integration)? 
To get the integration constant consider that even with no production 
there is €{{ g.Ko }} cost. 
<br>\(K(x)=\) 
%include('chcko/getorshow',idx = 2, show = util.tx(util.tex))
</li><li>
Write down the expression for the price-sales function p(x).
<br>\(p(x) =\) 
%include('chcko/getorshow',idx = 3, show = util.tx(util.tex))
</li><li>
Write down the price elasticity \(\epsilon(x)\) 
(use the Amoroso-Robinson-Relation or the definition of \(\epsilon\))
<br>\(\epsilon(x) =\)
%include('chcko/getorshow',idx = 4, show = util.tx(util.tex))
</li><li>
With what production quantity do we have maximum profit?
<br>\(x_g =\) 
%include('chcko/getorshow',idx = 5)
</li><li>
Is the demand at this production quantity elastic and why?
</li><li>
What price does one have to use to maximize the profit?
<br>\(p(x_g) =\)
%include('chcko/getorshow',idx = 6)
</li><li>
What is the name of this point \( (x_g,p(x_g)) \)?
</li>
