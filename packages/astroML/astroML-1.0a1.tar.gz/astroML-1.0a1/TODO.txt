plot_figures: make book title correct!  194 times...

examples: cleanup
- datasets
- tools shown in CIDU
- plotting/histograms

Core Package
------------
XD code:https://twitter.com/
- include mixing matrix (in original paper)
- submit to scikit-learn?

Bayesian Blocks code:
- other priors
- other fitness functions

KDE:
- build-in cross-validation
- KDE with errors

Web Page
--------
- add index of CIDU plots to web page
- chapter/figures order in index
- modify gen_rst to use thumbnails on index page, full size on code page.
- Think about suggested exercises with our code and data

Lomb-scargle:
 - optimize with extirpolation
 - write documentation
 - write tests

Extreme Deconvolution:
 - regularization (look at how GMM does this)
 - optimize linear algebra
 - allow for automatic treatment of diagonal variance
 - allow for covariance_type argument as in GMM
 - better documentation
 - tests
 - submit to scikit-learn?

Utilities:
 - look through code examples; find often-used subroutines

Misc:
 - clean up MCMC log(sigma) priors (use @pymc.deterministic)

Website:
 - Link to code and instructions for installation
 - List and link to dependencies
 - Show thumbnails on figure index
