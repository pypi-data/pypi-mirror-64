Description: This asynchronous Python library provides periodic discovery, control and push-based status for SenseME fans by Big Ass Fans. It was developed mainly to provide access to SenseME fans for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) using asyncio but should work fine in other applications.
        
        This library (based on [TomFaulkner's](https://github.com/TomFaulkner/SenseMe) library) keeps an open socket to each controlled fan so that state changes from any source including local control are pushed more or less immediately. This approach is far more robust and responsive. A discovery task was also added to periodically detect SenseME devices on the network.
        
        Sniffing the packets and documenting the protocol was the work of [Bruce](http://bruce.pennypacker.org/tag/senseme-plugin/). His work in making an [Indigo plugin](https://github.com/bpennypacker/SenseME-Indigo-Plugin) made this library possible.
        
        ## Command line access
        
        The aiosenseme package now installs a command line script along with the package. To discover all fans on the network type the following.
        
        ```console
        $ aiosenseme --discover
        Studio Beam Fan
          Room Name: Studio Fans, Room Type: Family Room
          Model: Haiku Fan with light, FW Version: 2.5.0
          IP Addr: 192.168.1.2, MAC Addr: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
          Token: 73264cb2-1234-1234-1234-012345678912
        Studio Vault Fan
          Room Name: Studio Fans, Room Type: Family Room
          Model: Haiku Fan with light, FW Version: 2.5.0
          IP Addr: 192.168.1.3, MAC Addr: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
          Token: 73264cb2-1234-1234-1234-012345678913
        ```
        
        Here both the fan speed is set and the light is turned on. The room name was used to set the fan so all fans in that room changed to the same state. Keep in mind that changing an individual fan that is a member of a room will do the same thing. Notice also that Whoosh was turned off when the fan speed was set specific value.
        
        ```console
        mike@Desktop-Mike:~$ aiosenseme -n "Studio Fans" --speed 3 --light on
        Studio Beam Fan
          Room Name: Studio Fans, Room Type: Family Room
          Model: Haiku Fan with light, FW Version: 2.5.0
          IP Addr: 192.168.1.2, MAC Addr: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
          Token: 73264cb2-1234-1234-1234-012345678912
        State: Fan is on (speed: 2), Light is off, Whoosh: ON
        New State: Fan is on (speed: 3), Light is on (brightness: 16), Whoosh: OFF
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Python 3.7 is required to use this library.
        SenseME devices communicate on UDP port 31415 using broadcast and unicast traffic this port must be available and not blocked by a firewall.
