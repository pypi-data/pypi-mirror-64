Examples
--------

All classes (except the reports class) correspond to one of the `Product Specific Scopus APIs <https://dev.elsevier.com/api_docs.html>`_.

There are Search APIs and Retrieval APIs. They have in common that the obtained result is cached in a subfolder in `~/.scopus/` on your hard drive. Subsequent analysis becomes much quicker this way. A boolean `refresh` parameter steers whether this file should be refreshed or not.
