By Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

The Collatz sequence is a sequence of numbers produced from a
starting number, following two rules:

1) If the current number N is even, the next number is N / 2.
2) If the current Number N is odd, the next number is N * 3 + 1.

The sequence terminates when N becomes 1. It is generally thought,
but so far not mathematically proven, that every starting number
eventually terminates.
