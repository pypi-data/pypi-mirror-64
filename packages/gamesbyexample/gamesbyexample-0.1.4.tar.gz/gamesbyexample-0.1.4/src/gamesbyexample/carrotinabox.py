By Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

This is a bluffing game for two human players. Each player has a box.
One box has a carrot in it. To win, you must have the box with the
carrot in it.

This is a very simple and silly game.

The first player looks into their box (the second player must close
their eyes during this.) The first player then says "There is a carrot
in my box" or "There is not a carrot in my box". The second player then
gets to decide if they want to swap boxes or not.
