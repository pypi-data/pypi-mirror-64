"""Fizz Buzz Calculation, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

Fizz Buzz is a game where you count up from 1. If the number is a
multiple of 3, you say "fizz" instead of the number. If the number is a
multiple of 5, you say "buzz" instead of the number. If the number is a
multiple of 3 and 5, you say "fizzbuzz".
