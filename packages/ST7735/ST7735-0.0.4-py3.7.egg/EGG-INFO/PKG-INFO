        Python library to control an ST7735 TFT LCD display. Allows simple
        drawing on the display without installing a kernel module.
        
        Designed specifically to work with a ST7735 based 160x80 pixel TFT SPI
        display. (Specifically the 0.96" SPI LCD from Pimoroni).
        
        Make sure you have the following dependencies:
        
        ::
        
           sudo apt-get update
           sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio python-spidev python-pip python-imaging python-numpy
        
        Install this library by running:
        
        ::
        
           sudo pip install st7735
        
        See example of usage in the examples folder.
        
        Licensing & History
        ===================
        
        This library is a modification of a modification of code originally
        written by Tony DiCola for Adafruit Industries, and modified to work
        with the ST7735 by Clement Skau.
        
        It has been modified by Pimoroni to include support for their 160x80 SPI
        LCD breakout, and hopefully also generalised enough so that it will
        support other ST7735-powered displays.
        
        Modifications include:
        ----------------------
        
        -  PIL/Pillow has been removed from the underlying display driver to
           separate concerns- you should create your own PIL image and display
           it using ``display(image)``
        -  ``width``, ``height``, ``rotation``, ``invert``, ``offset_left`` and
           ``offset_top`` parameters can be passed into ``__init__`` for
           alternate displays
        -  ``Adafruit_GPIO`` has been replaced with ``RPi.GPIO`` and ``spidev``
           to closely align with our other software (IE: Raspberry Pi only)
        -  Test fixtures have been added to keep this library stable
