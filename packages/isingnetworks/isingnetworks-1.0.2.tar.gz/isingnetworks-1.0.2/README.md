# Ising Model on Networks

This is a python package which simulates the Ising model on complex networks.

Given any network built using the networkx package as input, this package runs Monte Carlo simulations on random source nodes and evaluates the model according to the Metropolis algorithm, and returns the magnetization and the energy of the system.

Version 1.0.2: This has an added visualizer to plot the output graphs.

## Installation

Run the following to install:
```python
pip install isingnetworks
```
