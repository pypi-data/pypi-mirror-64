    Parameters:
        X_y (generator): A stream of (features, target) tuples.
        moment (callable or str): The attribute used for measuring time. If a callable
            is passed, then it is expected to take as input a `dict` of features. If ``None``, then
            the observations are implicitely timestamped in the order in which they arrive. If a
            ``str`` is passed, then it will be used to obtain the time from the input features.
        delay (callable or str or datetime.timedelta or int): The amount to wait before revealing
            the target associated with each observation to the model. This value is expected to be
            able to sum with the ``moment`` value. For instance, if ``moment`` is a
            `datetime.date`, then ``delay`` is expected to be a `datetime.timedelta`. If a callable
            is passed, then it is expected to take as input a `dict` of features and the target. If
            a `str` is passed, then it will be used to access the relevant field from the features.
            If ``None`` is passed, then no delay will be used, which leads to doing standard online
            validation. If a scalar is passed, such an `int` or a `datetime.timedelta`, then the
            delay is constant.
        copy (bool): If ``True``, then a separate copy of the features are yielded the second time
            around. This ensures that inadvertent modifications in downstream code don't have any
            effect.
