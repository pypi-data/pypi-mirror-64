"""Anomaly detection.

The estimators in ``anomaly`` are slightly different than the rest of the estimators. Instead of a
``predict_one`` method, each anomaly detector has a ``score_one`` method which returns an anomaly
score for a given set of features. High scores indicate anomalies whereas low scores indicate
normal observations will have low scores. Note that the range of the scores depends on each
particular estimator.
