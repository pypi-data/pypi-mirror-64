# Getting Started

## Step 1. install flow360 client
Make sure you have setuptools. If not, sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
```
pip install flow360client
```

## Step 2. Signing in with your account and password
An account can be created at www.flexcompute.com
```
python3
>>> import flow360client
simulation.cloud email:********@gmail.com
Password: ***********
Do you want to keep logged in on this machine ([Y]es / [N]o)Y
```

## Step 3. Upload a mesh file
First, specify a list of no-slip walls. If you have a .mapbc file, there is a function that will do this for you:
```
>>>noSlipWalls = flow360client.noSlipWallsFromMapbc('/path/to/meshname.mapbc')
```
Then submit a mesh
```
>>>meshId = flow360client.NewMesh(fname='flow360/tests/data/wing_tetra.1.lb8.ugrid', noSlipWalls=noSlipWalls, meshName='my_experiment', tags=['wing'])
```
Replace above fname and noSlipWalls with your own file path and parameter.
Parameter inputs of mesh name and tags are optional.
Upon this command finishing, it will return the mesh Id '<mesh_id>'. Use that for next step.

Note:
By default, submited mesh file will be processed using latest major release (e.g. 0.2.x) . If you want to run with another version of the solve, please specify in the argument as example:
```
>>>meshId = flow360client.NewMesh(fname='flow360/tests/data/wing_tetra.1.lb8.ugrid', noSlipWalls=noSlipWalls, meshName='my_experiment', tags=['wing'], solverVersion='release-0.2.1')
```

## Step 4. Upload a case file
First, prepare a JSON input file, either manually or by using the fun3d_to_flow360.py script:
```
python3 /path/to/flow360/flow360client/fun3d_to_flow360.py /path/to/fun3d.nml /path/to/mesh.mapbc /output/path/for/Flow360.json

```
Then submit a case:
```
>>> caseId = flow360client.NewCase(meshId='<mesh_id>', config='/output/path/for/Flow360.json', caseName='case2', tags=['wing'])
```
Replace the mesh id generated from above step, and give your own config path.
Parameter inputs of caseName and tags are optional.
Upon this command finishing, it will return the case Id '<case_id>'. Use that for next step.

### Step 5. Checking the case status
```
>>> flow360client.case.GetCaseInfo('<case_id>')
```
Look for field of "status" from printed result. A case status can be: 1) queued; 2) running; and 3) completed

## FAQ.

### How do I download or view a finished case result?
To download the surface data (surface distributions and slices):
```
>>>flow360client.case.DownloadSurfaceResults('<case_id>', '/tmp/surfaces.tar.gz')
```
Replace the second parameter with your target location and output file name, ending with '.tar.gz'.

To download the entire flowfield:
```
>>>flow360client.case.DownloadVolumetricResults('<case_id>', '/tmp/volume.tar.gz')
```

### My case is still running, but how can I check current residual or surface force result?
```
## this print out csv formated content
>>>flow360client.case.GetCaseResidual('<case_id>') 
>>>flow360client.case.GetCaseSurfaceForces('<case_id>', [{'surfaceName' : <surface_name0>, 'surfaceIds' : [<id0>, <id1>, ...]}])
```

### Where is my AWS credential stored locally?
Your AWS credential is encrypted and stored locally (if you hit Yes previously at authentication step) at
```
~/.flow360/
```
For security, your password is stored as hashed value, so nobody can guess your password.

### How to check my mesh processing status?
```
## to list all your mesh files
>>> flow360client.mesh.ListMeshes()
## to view one particular mesh
>>> flow360client.mesh.GetMeshInfo('<mesh_id>')
```

### How can I delete my mesh or case?
```
## Delete a mesh
>>>flow360client.mesh.DeleteMesh('<mesh_id>')
## Delete a case
>>> flow360client.case.DeleteCase('<case_id>')
```
Caution: You won't be able to recover your deleted case or mesh files including its results after your deletion.

# Version history
Results between major versions (e.g. x.y.0) may differ slightly. However, results among minor versions (e.g. 0.2.x) will not change.

## release-0.1
* Viscous gradient scheme changed from node-based Green-Gauss gradients to a Least-squares gradient scheme
* Improved both pressure and velocity limiters to help with supersonic and transonic cases.

## release-0.2.0
* Minor modifications to enhance convergence

## release-0.2.1
* Added support for tecplot .szplt output
* Added support for slicing of the final flowfield

## release-0.3.0
* Implemented incremental back-off in solution update
* Replaced the pressure/density limiters which were edge-based with node-based limiters.
* Improved the stability properties of the solution gradient used for the viscous fluxes. 
* Now using a blending of corrected and uncorrected viscous scheme. This effectively limits how much the corrected viscous scheme can differ from the uncorrected scheme. This is necessary because the Jacobian only includes contributions from the uncorrected scheme. 
* Bug fix for supersonic farfield boundary condition. 
* Tecplot output and single-file surface and slice output
