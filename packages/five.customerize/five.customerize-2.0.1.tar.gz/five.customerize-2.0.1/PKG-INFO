        Overview
        --------
        
        ``five.customerize`` is an add-on for the Zope Applicationserver.
        It provides the ability to customize Page-Template-based browser-views through the web.
        
        It was created to replace the old CMF's portal_skin tools,
        where it is possible to customize old-style file-system based page templates.
