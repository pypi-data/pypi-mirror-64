Structure of tsam
#################

Tsam consists of a main class containing the basic functionailities to aggregate time series to typical periods based
on averaging, k-means clustering of hierarchical clustering. The utils-folder contains additional clustering algorithms
including a mixed-interger linear programming based formulation of the k-medoids algorithm and constrained agglomerative
clustering of adjacent time steps called segmentation.
