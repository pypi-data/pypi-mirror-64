# cdm-sysinfo-plugin
The project is a [Codimension Python IDE](http://codimension.org) system info plugin.

With this plugin a couple of the main window status bar widgets are added: one
for the CPU usage percentage and one for the memory usage percentage.

# Installation
The plugin is pip installable:

```bash
pip install cdmsysinfoplugin
```

There is a little value (if any) to install it without the
[Codimension IDE](http://codimension.org).
