version 1.1.1 - 2020/03/23

new features:
- changed the way logging in handled.
- RNO-G hardware response added

version 1.1.0 - 2020/01/15

new features:
- added module registry. By adding a decorator to the run methods of every module, we keep track of the modules applied to an event
-Added new module called "beamFormingDirectionFitter" that fits direction through an interferometry method (dubbed beamForming)
-Added the internal clock parameter (time since last trigger with ms precision) to ARIANNA paremeters (key number 8)
-Changed import "detector_sql" to "from NuRadioReco.detector import detector_sql" and .GetSec() to datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(self.config_tree.TrigStartClock.GetCurrTime()) in the detector.py and readARIANNAdataCalin.py files respectively in order to make it python3 compatible.
-Updated documentation and made it deployable on github
-Changed normalization of the frequency spectrum. The amplitude is now given as V/GHz (or V/m/GHz for E-fields) instead of
   V/GHz/bin. This way, the values of trace.get_frequency_spectrum() are independent of the sampling rate. The fft utilities
   now also need the sampling rate as an argument.
-Envelope phased array available
-Trigger times now include the time with respect to the first interaction (vertex times)
-Analog to digital converter module added
-Improved calculation of the diode noise parameters

Detector description can be stored in .nur files
Large overhaul of the event structure. Adds shower classes and hybrid detector information.

bugfixes:
-Fixes increase in filesize caused by switch to python3
-Fixed bug when using no secondary channels on the phased array
-Fixed bug when using ARA trigger

version 1.0.0 - 2019/08/30 - first python 3 release
