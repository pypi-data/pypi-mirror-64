        ## What is CluBCpG?
        CluBCpG is a software package built to analyze whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data. This toolkit will divide each chromosome into small user-defined intervals, extract all WGBS reads within those intervals, cluster them based on identity, and write a final report to the use containing all identified CpG methylation patterns.
        
        ## How do I use this?
        Full documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://clubcpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
        
        ### Requirements
        * Python >= 3.5
        * Installation of Samtools on your PATH
        
        ### Install
        * __(Optional, but HIGHLY recommended)__ Create a new python virtual environment and activate that virualenv
        * Execute `pip install clubcpg` to install the package. Requirements will automatically be installed if not already present.
