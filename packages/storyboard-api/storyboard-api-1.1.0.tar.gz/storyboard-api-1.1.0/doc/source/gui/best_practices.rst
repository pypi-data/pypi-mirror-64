Organizing a Team
=================

#. Tags: Teams should decide on a list of tags they will be using and document
   them. Examples: nova-m1, bug, driver, low-hanging-fruit. The tags that are
   important to your team will depend heavily on how you like to organize work.
   If your team targets milestones, you might need tags for the milestones. If
   your team has a lot of driver work and you have a tag for each vendor, you
   should use those. In the end, the only thing that is important is that they
   are clear and well documented. 
   
#. Boards: Two of the most common ways of organizing works in boards are-

   #. Using a board to organize work in a kanban style- worklists for new,
      backlog, in progress, and done. Stories are arranged in the list by
      priority- higher priority items closer to the top.

   #. A board per release with each worklist being a separate milestone.
      Stories that are in the worklist are organized by priority. 
   
#. Worklists: Worklists can exist in a board or on their own. Most often, they
   are used in the context of boards.


Organizing Your Work
====================

Its possible, even likely, that your personal priorities differ from
that of the project(s) you are working on. You might have to balance
and organize work you are involved in between several projects and
SIGs. This is why StoryBoard supports the creation of worklists and
boards by anyone.
