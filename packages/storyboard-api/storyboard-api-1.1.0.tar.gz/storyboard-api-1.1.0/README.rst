Storyboard
==========

Storyboard is a task tracker created to serve the needs of highly-distributed
systems that span multiple projects, to enable cross-project work on a massive
scale.  Concepts were adapted from existing tools, and as many potential points
of contention were removed as possible, to better facilitate coordination of
project work by stakeholders with widely varied interests and needs.
