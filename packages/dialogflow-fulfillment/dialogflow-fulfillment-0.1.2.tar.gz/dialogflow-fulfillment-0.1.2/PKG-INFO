        This is an unofficial Dialogflow Fulfillment package for Python 3+.
        
        This package can be used to manipulate or create messages, output contexts and followup events for a matched intent.
        
        > When an intent with fulfillment enabled is matched, Dialogflow sends a request to your webhook service with information about the matched intent. Your system can perform any required actions and respond to Dialogflow with information for how to proceed.
        >

        ## Installing
        
        ### Via `pip`
        
        `dialogflow-fulfillment` is available for download from PyPI via `pip`:
        
        ```shell
        pip install dialogflow-fulfillment
        ```
        
        ### From source
        
        To install `dialogflow-fulfillment` from source, clone this repository and run `setup.py install` from the project's root directory:
        
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/gcaccaos/dialogflow-fulfillment.git
        cd dialogflow-fulfillment
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### For development
        
        The package can be installed from source with `pip` in __editable mode__ or with `setup.py` in __development mode__, which means that there's no need to install from source after every change in the code.
        
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/gcaccaos/dialogflow-fulfillment.git
        cd dialogflow-fulfillment
        
        pip install -e .
        
        # or
        
        python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        ## Quick start
        
        ```python
        from dialogflow_fulfillment import WebhookClient
        
        
        def handler(agent):
            """Custom handler function"""
        
        
        # Create an instance of WebhookClient
        agent = WebhookClient(request)
        
        # Handle the request using a handler function or map of handlers
        agent.handle_request(handler)
        
        # Get the response dictionary
        response = agent.response
        ```

        ## Testing
        
        Tests for this package are written with `unittest` and managed by `tox`.
        
        The `tox.ini` file at the project's root directory is used for configuring the tests.
        
        To run the tests, clone this repository, install `tox` via `pip` and run `tox` command from the project's root directory:

        tox
        ```
        
        ## Limitations
        
        * Currently supports responses only for generic platforms
        
        ## TODO
        
        * Add support for platforms
        * Add support for other rich responses
        * Add unit tests
        * Add documentation
