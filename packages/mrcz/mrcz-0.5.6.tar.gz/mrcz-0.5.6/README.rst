==============================================
Python MRCZ meta-compressed file-format module
==============================================

``mrcz`` is a package designed to supplement the venerable MRC image file 
format with a highly efficient compressed variant, using the ``blosc`` 
meta-compressor library to shrink files on disk and greatly accelerate file 
input/output for the era of "Big Data" in electron and optical microscopy.

Python versions 2.7, 3.4-3.6 are supported.

``mrcz`` is currently considered to be a `beta` development state.

``mrcz`` is released under the BSD 3-clause license.

Installation
------------

A scientific Python installation (such as Anaconda, WinPython, or Canopy) is 
advised. After installation of your Python environment, from a command prompt 
type::

    pip install mrcz

``mrcz`` has the following dependencies:

* ``numpy``
* ``blosc`` (optionally, but highly recommended)

Feature List
------------

* Import: DM4, MRC, MRCZ formats
* Export: MRC, MRCZ formats
* Compress and bit-shuffle image stacks and volumes with ``blosc`` meta-compressor
* Asynchronous read and write operations.
* Support in the ``hyperspy`` electron microscopy package.
