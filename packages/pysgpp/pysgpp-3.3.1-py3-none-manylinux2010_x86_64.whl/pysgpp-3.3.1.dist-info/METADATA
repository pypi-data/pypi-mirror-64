Summary: The sparse grids toolkit SG++
 SG++ is a collection of numerical algorithms for sparse grids. It
 contains modules for interpolation, quadrature, data mining
 (regression, classification, clustering), optimization, PDEs, and
 more. SG++ implements algorithms for spatially adaptive grids and
 also provides a module for the combination technique. Many of the
 implemented algorithms are also available as a high-performance
 version, often orders of magnitude faster than standard
 implementations.

SG⁺⁺ is a library and framework for sparse grids in different flavors.
SG⁺⁺ supports both hierarchical spatially-adaptive sparse grids and the
dimensionally-adaptive sparse grid combination technique.

You are invited to use, contribute, discuss, …

The library is free to use, provided proper credit is given.

For more details and the API documentation, please visit http://sgpp.sparsegrids.org.

You can find binaries for Linux (deb) and MATLAB support in the
[SG++ releases](https://github.com/SGpp/SGpp/releases).
