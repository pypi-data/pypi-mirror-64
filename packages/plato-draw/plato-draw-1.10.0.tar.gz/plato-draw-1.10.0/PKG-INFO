Description: =================================
        Welcome to plato's documentation!
        =================================
        
        Plato is designed for efficient visualization of particle data. Think
        of it sort of like matplotlib, but being less focused on 2D plotting.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Plato is available on PyPI for installation via pip::
        
          $ pip install plato-draw
        
        You can also install plato from source, like this::
        
           $ git clone https://github.com/glotzerlab/plato.git
           $ # now install
           $ cd plato && python setup.py install
        
        .. note::
        
           Depending on which backends you want to use, there may be
           additional steps required; see the section on interactive backends
           below.
        
        Using Interactive Backends
        --------------------------
        
        Plato contains a number of backends, each with its own set of
        dependencies. Getting the vispy backend working for both the desktop
        and jupyter notebook can be tricky. Make sure to check the official
        `vispy documentation <http://vispy.org/installation.html>`_. We also
        keep some advice `here
        <https://bitbucket.org/snippets/glotzer/nMg8Gr/plato-dependency-installation-tips>`_
        regarding particular known-good versions of dependencies for pip and
        conda.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        The documentation is available as standard sphinx documentation::
        
          $ cd doc
          $ make html
        
        Automatically-built documentation is available at
        https://plato-draw.readthedocs.io .
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Several usage examples are available. Many simple, but less
        interesting, scenes can be found in `the test demo scene script
        <https://github.com/glotzerlab/plato/blob/master/test/test_scenes.py>`_,
        available as `live examples on mybinder.org
        <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/glotzerlab/plato/master?filepath=examples>`_. Somewhat
        less transparent examples can be found in `the plato-gallery
        repository <https://github.com/glotzerlab/plato-gallery>`_.
