    Make identical concurrent calls to a function.

    Args:
        concurrency (int): how many calls to make in parallel
        function (Union[function, str]): the function to call, or
            the 'dotted module.path.to:function' as a string (NOTE

            NOTE:
            when `f` is a decorated function where decorator returns a new
            object and functools.wraps was not used (and maybe some other
            cases too) we need to be able to tell our subprocess how to
            import `f`... in this case using string path is mandatory (as
            we cannot introspect it)
        **kwargs: kwargs to pass to `function`

    Returns:
        List[Any]: return values from each run `function`
            (results are returned in order that tasks were enqueued)

    NOTE:
        `kwargs` must be pickleable
