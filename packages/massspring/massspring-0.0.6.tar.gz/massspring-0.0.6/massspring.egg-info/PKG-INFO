        ## Brief
        
        using this library you can create great simulations of most of physical environments which can be calculated presizely. you can create many types of objects from which "mass" and "spring" are main ones.  
        more information is available on [project homepage on github](https://github.com/pooya-shams/massspring) and [README](https://github.com/pooya-shams/massspring/blob/master/massspring/README.md)
