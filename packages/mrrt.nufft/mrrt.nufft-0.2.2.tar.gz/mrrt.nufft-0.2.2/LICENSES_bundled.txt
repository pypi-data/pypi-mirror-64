mrrt.nufft builds upon some compatibly licensed 3rd party code:

1.) Code for handling compilation flags (e.g. for OpenMP) when building C
    extensions is adapted from DIPY.

    Name: DIPY (http://nipy.org/dipy/)
    Files:  setup.py, setup_helpers.py
    License: 3-clause BSD


2.) The CPU-based implementation began as a translation of the Matlab-based
    NUFFT implementation found in the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox
    created by Jeff Fessler and his students. The original Matlab toolbox is
    available from
    http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/.

    Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox license:
      (as stated at: http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/)

    You may freely use and distribute this software as long as you retain the
    author's name (myself and/or my students) with the software.
    It would also be courteous for you to cite the toolbox and any related
    publications in any papers that present results based on this software.
    UM and the authors make all the usual disclaimers about liability etc.
    If you make changes to any files, then please change the file name before
    redistributing to avoid confusion (like the GNU software license). Better
    yet, email me the changes and I'll consider incorporating them into the
    toolbox.
