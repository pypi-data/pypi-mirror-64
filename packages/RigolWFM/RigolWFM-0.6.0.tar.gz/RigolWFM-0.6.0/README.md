# Parsing binary .wfm files created by Rigol scopes

## Usage

The RigolWFM package can be installed via `pip`::

    pip install RigolWFM

Once this is done, one can extract signals from binary Rigol `.wfm` files by::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import RigolWFM.wfm as rigol

    filename = 'example.wfm'
    scope = 'DS1000E'

    w = rigol.Wfm.from_file(filename, scope)
    w.plot()
    plt.show()
    
Alternatively, `wfmconvert` can be used from the command line.  For example, the following should convert all the DS1000E files in the current directory to the `.csv` format::

    prompt> wfmconvert 1000E csv *.wfm

## Background

This project is should be a one-stop location for interpreting waveform `.wmf` files from any Rigol scopes.  Programs that parse Rigol's binary `.wfm` files are sadly balkanized: each project tends to support a single scope model and the available efforts are spread across a range of languages.

Most seem to avoid do not deal specifically with the `.wfm` format and if they do, then only one specific scope model is supported.

Initially, I too, was only interested in a single scope format (DS1102E) and I successfully used the python parser written by Blaicher <https://github.com/mabl/pyRigolWFM>.  Later, I realized that DS1000Z files were parsed by Szkutnik  <https://github.com/michal-szkutnik/pyRigolWfm1000Z> and added support for these scopes.  Eventually, I ran across the work on DS4000 files by Cat-Ion <https://github.com/Cat-Ion/rigol-ds4000-wfm>.

This last project leveraged Kaitai Struct <https://kaitai.io> as a domain specific language to represent the binary files.  Once a binary file has been described in the `.ksy` format, parsers can be generated for a wide range of languages (C++/STL, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby).  Moreover, Kaitai Struct has a Web IDE <https://ide.kaitai.io> that allows one to interactively reverse engineer binary file formats.  This is super helpful for those Rigol `.wfm` formats that are undocumented.


## Status

There is a bit of work remaining (testing, validation, repackaging) but at least there are now binary file descriptions for `.wfm` files for the following scopes:

* DS1000C untested
* DS1000E tested
* DS1000Z tested, but with wonky voltage offsets
* DS2000 tested
* DS4000 tested
* DS6000 untested

## Resources

This has been a bit of an adventure.  In the process of nailing down the basic formats, I have gleaned information from a wide range of projects started by others.
