Description: cdm-gc-plugin
        =============
        
        The project is a `Codimension Python IDE <http://codimension.org>`__
        garbage collector plugin.
        
        The idea of the plugin is simple. The embedded Python garbage collector
        triggers objects collection at pretty much unknown moments and the
        plugin will make it more predictable. The plugin will call the
        **``collect()``** method of the Python gc module when:
        
        -  a tab is closed
        -  a project is changed
        -  new files appeared in a project
        -  some files are deleted from a project
        
        There is pretty much no user interface for the plugin. It does its work
        in the background.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The plugin is pip installable:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           pip install cdmgcplugin
        
        There is a little value (if any) to install it without the `Codimension
        IDE <http://codimension.org>`__. It however can be a good start point in
        developing a new plugin for Codimension. The overall structure could be
        copied as well as the way the plugin is installed.
