        ## Overview
        
        This is a basic project for serving a npm-managed React
        app with Flask.  It renders twitter query results
        in a grid in a way convenient for diplaying on
         a kiosk or large screen.
         
        ## Package-based installation
        
        Create a (python 3) virtualenv and
        install using one of the following methods:
        
        ### From PyPi
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install frtg
        ```
        
        ### From Source
        
        ```bash
        $ python setup.py sdist
        $ pip install dist/frtg-x.y.z.tar.gz
        ```
        
        # Running
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Use `config-example.json` as a template to
        create a configuration file.
        When running the server an environment variable called
        `CONFIG_FILENAME` and containing the path to this
        configuration file must be present.
        
        ## Starting the Server
        
        ```bash
        CONFIG_FILENAME=config.json FLASK_APP=frtg flask run
        ```
        
        Note: if you are running from a source distribution
        and didn't install it in your virtualenv, you should
        execute the above from the top-level folder.
        
        Alternatively, using the provided `app.py`
        might sometimes be convenient when developing:
        
        ```bash
        CONFIG_FILENAME=config.json python frtg/app.py
        ```
        
        or:
        
        ```bash
        CONFIG_FILENAME=config.json python -m frtg.app
        ```
        
        
        ## Development Environment
        
        These notes are for setting up a development environment.
        
        ### Setup
        
        Create a (python 3) virtualenv and install the requirements:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ... and, to install additional libraries used by the test scripts:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Set up the node environment:
        
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
        
        ### Generate Javascript Bundle
        
        In a fresh environment, or whenever the ui
        sources are changed:
        
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
