  :ref:`rfix` directives can specify the replacement comment over multiple

* :ref:`nonEntryBlocks` in a skool file are reproduced by :ref:`skool2asm.py`
  and preserved by :ref:`skool2ctl.py`
* Moved the ability to generate a control file from :ref:`sna2skool.py` to the
  new :ref:`sna2ctl.py` command
* :ref:`skool2bin.py` now processes :ref:`asm-if` directives (in case they

* The :ref:`label` directive can now add an entry point marker to the next
  instruction, or remove one if present

* Added support for appending content to an existing ref file section by adding

  restoring them from a control file or skool file template
* Added support to the :ref:`list`, :ref:`table` and :ref:`udgtable` macros for

  renders each list item or table row when reading from a control file)

  given as the first positional argument; any other positional arguments are
  interpreted as extra ref files
* Every entry title on a memory map page is now hyperlinked to the disassembly

* Fixed the bug in :ref:`skool2ctl.py` that makes it incorrectly compute the
  length of an ``M`` directive covering a sub-block containing two or more
