"""A settings manager for Paranoid Scientist.  This manages settings
at a global level.

We use a class here as a singleton.  Rather than a "true" Java-style
singleton, this is just a class which cannot be instantiated, and thus
has a single state.  We use this instead of something at the module
level in order to prevent a "import *" statement from causing
problems.

    Settings can be set either globally or locally.  To change a
    setting globally, call Settings.set().  To change a setting
    locally (on a per-function basis) using a decorator.  For this,
    please refer to the paranoidconfig decorator in decorators.py.

    Settings can be viewed with Settings.get().

    Note that this "class" is a singleton namespace with exclusively
    static methods.  It should not be instantiated.
