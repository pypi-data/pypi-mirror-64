.. note::

    The BeeWare project *has* tooling for Android. Unfortunately, due to some
    recent changes in the Android ecosystem, combined with some changes in Toga
    itself, means that our Android tooling is currently broken. We're working
    on it, and hope to have a solution in the very near future.

When generating an Android project, Briefcase produces a Gradle project.
