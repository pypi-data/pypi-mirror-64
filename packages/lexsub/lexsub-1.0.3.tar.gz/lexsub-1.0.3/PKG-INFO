        # LexSub
        The Lexical Substitution task involves selecting and ranking lexical paraphrases for a target word in a given sentential context. In the task, annotators and systems find an alternative substitute word or phrase for a target word in context.
        The task involves both finding the synonyms and disambiguating the context.
        
        ## Example: 
        i/p  :  The wine was too strong to drink. \
        o/p :  The wine was too powerful (0.93) / potent (0.91) / hot (0.5) / solid (0.3) / hard(0.3) to drink.
        
        *Powerful* and *potent* are much better replacements as indicated by the score next to them as well. Whereas, all three are viable replacement candidates. \
        Now notice two important things that is interesting: 
        * Not all synonyms fit in the context.  (direct lexical substitutions won’t always work)
        * Not all words that fit in the context preserve the meaning of the sentence. (LM score doesn’t always correlate)
