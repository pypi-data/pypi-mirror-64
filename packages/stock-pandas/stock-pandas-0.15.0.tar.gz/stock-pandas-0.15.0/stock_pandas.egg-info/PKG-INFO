        # [stock-pandas](https://github.com/kaelzhang/stock-pandas)
        
        **stock-pandas** inherits and extends `pandas.DataFrame` to support:
        - Stock Statistics
        - Stock Indicators, including:
          - Trend-following momentum indicators, such as **MA**, **EMA**, **MACD**, **BBI**
          - Dynamic support and resistance indicators, such as **BOLL**
          - Over-bought / over-sold indicators, such as **KDJ**, **RSI**
        
        `stock-pandas` makes automatical trading much easier. `stock-pandas` requires Python >= **3.6**
        
        With the help of `stock-pandas` and mplfinance, we could easily draw something like:
        
        ![](boll.png)
        
        The code example is available at [here](https://github.com/kaelzhang/stock-pandas-examples/blob/master/example/bollinger_bands.ipynb).
        
        ## Install
        
        ```sh
        pip install stock-pandas
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```py
        from stock_pandas import StockDataFrame
        
        # or
        import stock_pandas as spd
        ```
        
        We also have some examples with annotations in the [`example`](https://github.com/kaelzhang/stock-pandas/tree/master/example) directory, you could use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) or Jupyter notebook to play with them.
        
        ### StockDataFrame
        
        `StockDataFrame` inherits from `pandas.DataFrame`, so if you are familiar with `pandas.DataFrame`, you are already ready to use `stock-pandas`
        
        ```py
        import pandas as pd
        stock = StockDataFrame(pd.read_csv('stock.csv'))
        ```
        
        As we know, we could use `[]`, which called **pandas indexing** (a.k.a. `__getitem__` in python) to select out lower-dimensional slices. In addition to indexing with `colname` (column name of the `DataFrame`), we could also do indexing by `directive`s.
        
        ```py
        stock[directive] # Gets a pandas.Series
        
        stock[[directive0, directive1]] # Gets a StockDataFrame
        ```
        
        We have an example to show the most basic indexing using `[directive]`
        
        ```py
        stock = StockDataFrame({
            'open' : ...,
            'high' : ...,
            'low'  : ...,
            'close': [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        })
        
        stock['ma:2']
        
        # 0    NaN
        # 1    5.5
        # 2    6.5
        # 3    7.5
        # 4    8.5
        # Name: ma:2,close, dtype: float64
        ```
        
        Which prints the 2-period simple moving average on column `"close"`.
        
        ### stock.exec(directive: str, create_column: bool=False) -> np.ndarray
        
        Executes the given directive and returns a numpy ndarray according to the directive.
        
        ```py
        stock['ma:5'] # returns a Series
        
        stock.exec('ma:5', create_column=True) # returns a numpy ndarray
        ```
        
        ```py
        # This will only calculate without creating a new column in the dataframe
        stock.exec('ma:20')
        ```
        
        ### stock.alias(alias: str, name: str) -> None
        
        Defines column alias or directive alias
        
        - **alias** `str` the alias name
        - **name** `str` the name of an existing column or the directive string
        
        ```py
        # Some plot library such as `mplfinance` requires a column named capitalized `Open`,
        # but it is ok, we could create an alias.
        stock.alias('Open', 'open')
        
        stock.alias('buy_point', 'kdj.j < 0')
        ```
        
        ### stock.append(other, *args, **kwargs) -> StockDataFrame
        
        Appends rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.
        
        This method has nearly the same hehavior of [`pandas.DataFrame.append()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.append.html), but instead it returns an instance of `StockDataFrame`
        
        ## Syntax of `directive`
        
        ```ebnf
        directive := command | command operator expression
        operator := '/' | '\' | '><' | '<' | '<=' | '==' | '>=' | '>'
        expression := float | command
        
        command := command_name | command_name : arguments
        command_name := main_command_name | main_command_name.sub_command_name
        main_command_name := alphabets
        sub_command_name := alphabets
        
        arguments := argument | argument , arguments
        argument := empty_string | string | ( directive )
        ```
        
        #### `directive` Example
        
        Here lists several use cases of column names
        
        ```py
        # The middle band of bollinger bands
        #   which is actually a 20-period (default) moving average
        stock['boll']
        
        # kdj j less than 0
        # This returns a series of bool type
        stock['kdj.j < 0']
        
        # 9-period kdj k cross up 3-day kdj d
        stock['kdj.k:9 / kdj.d:3']
        
        # 5-period simple moving average
        stock['ma:5']
        
        # 10-period simple moving average on open prices
        stock['ma:10,open']
        
        # Dataframe of 5-period, 10-period, 30-period ma
        stock[[
            'ma:5',
            'ma:10',
            'ma:30'
        ]]
        
        # Which means we use the default values of the first and the second parameters,
        # and specify the third parameter
        stock['macd:,,10']
        
        # We must wrap a parameter which is a nested command or directive
        stock['increase:(ma:20,close),3']
        
        # stock-pandas has a powerful directive parser,
        # so we could even write directives like this:
        stock['''
        repeat
            :
                (
                    column:close > boll.upper
                ),
                5
        ''']
        ```
        
        ## Built-in Commands of Indicators
        
        Document syntax explanation:
        
        - **param0** `str` which means `param0` is a required parameter of type `str`.
        - **param1?** `str='close'` which means parameter `param1` is optional with default value `'close'`.
        
        Actually, all parameters of a command are of string type, so the `str` here means an interger-like string.
        
        ### `ma`, simple Moving Averages
        
        ```
        ma:<period>,<column>
        ```
        
        Gets the `period`-period simple moving average on column named `column`.
        
        `SMA` is often confused between simple moving average and smoothed moving average.
        
        So `stock-pandas` will use `ma` for simple moving average and `smma` for smoothed moving average.
        
        - **period** `int` (required)
        - **column?** `enum<'open'|'high'|'low'|'close'>='close'` Which column should the calculation based on. Defaults to `'close'`
        
        ```py
        # which is equivalent to `stock['ma:5,close']`
        stock['ma:5']
        
        stock['ma:10,open']
        ```
        
        ### `ema`, Exponential Moving Average
        
        ```
        ema:<period>,<column>
        ```
        
        Gets the Exponential Moving Average, also known as the Exponential Weighted Moving Average.
        
        The arguments of this command is the same as `ma`.
        
        ### `macd`, Moving Average Convergence Divergence
        
        ```
        macd:<fast_period>,<slow_period>
        macd.signal:<fast_period>,<slow_period>,<signal_period>
        macd.histogram:<fast_period>,<slow_period>,<signal_period>
        ```
        
        - **fast_period?** `int=12` fast period (short period). Defaults to `12`.
        - **slow_period?** `int=26` slow period (long period). Defaults to `26`
        - **signal_period?** `int=9` signal period. Defaults to `9`
        
        ```py
        # macd
        stock['macd']
        stock['macd.dif']
        
        # macd signal band, which is a shortcut for stock['macd.signal']
        stock['macd.s']
        stock['macd.signal']
        stock['macd.dea']
        
        # macd histogram band, which is equivalent to stock['macd.h']
        stock['macd.histogram']
        stock['macd.h']
        stock['macd.macd']
        ```
        
        ### `boll`, BOLLinger bands
        
        ```
        boll:<period>,<column>
        boll.upper:<period>,<times>,<column>
        boll.lower:<period>,<times>,<column>
        ```
        
        - **period?** `int=20`
        - **times?** `int=2`
        - **column?** `str='close'`
        
        ```py
        # boll
        stock['boll']
        
        # bollinger upper band, a shortcut for stock['boll.upper']
        stock['boll.u']
        stock['boll.upper]
        
        # bollinger lower band, which is equivalent to stock['boll.l']
        stock['boll.lower']
        stock['boll.l']
        ```
        
        ### `rsv`, Raw Stochastic Value
        
        ```
        rsv:<period>
        ```
        
        Calculates the raw stochastic value which is often used to calculate KDJ
        
        ### `kdj`, stochastic oscillator
        
        ```
        kdj.k:<param_k>
        kdj.d:<param_d>
        kdj.j:<param_j>
        ```
        
        - **param_k?** `int=9`
        - **param_d?** `int=9`
        - **param_j?** `int=9`
        
        ```py
        # The k series of KDJ 999
        stock['kdj.k']
        
        # The KDJ serieses of with parameters 9, 3, and 3
        stock[['kdj.k', 'kdj.d:3', 'kdj.j:3']]
        ```
        
        ### `rsi`, Relative Strength Index
        
        ```
        rsi:<period>
        ```
        
        Calculates the N-period RSI (Relative Strength Index)
        
        - **period** `int` The period to calculate RSI. `period` should be an int which is larger than `1`
        
        ### `bbi`, Bull and Bear Index
        
        ```
        bbi:<a>,<b>,<c>,<d>
        ```
        
        Calculates indicator BBI (Bull and Bear Index) which is the average of `ma:3`, `ma:6`, `ma:12`, `ma:24` by default
        
        - **a?** `int=3`
        - **b?** `int=6`
        - **c?** `int=12`
        - **d?** `int=24`
        
        ## Built-in Commands for Statistics
        
        ### `column`
        
        ```
        column:<name>
        ```
        
        Just gets the series of a column. This command is designed to be used together with an operator to compare with another command or as a parameter of some statistics command.
        
        - **name** `str` the name of the column
        
        ### `increase`
        
        ```
        increase:<on_what>,<repeat>,<step>
        ```
        
        Gets a `bool`-type series each item of which is `True` if the value of indicator `on_what` increases in the last `period`-period.
        
        - **on_what** `str` the command name of an indicator.
        - **repeat?** `int=1`
        - **direction?** `1 | -1` the direction of "increase". `-1` means decreasing
        
        For example:
        
        ```py
        # Which means whether the `ma:20,close` line
        # (a.k.a. 20-period simple moving average on column `'close'`)
        # has been increasing repeatedly for 3 times (maybe 3 days)
        stock['increase:(ma:20,close),3']
        
        # If the close price has been decreasing repeatedly for 5 times (maybe 5 days)
        stock['increase:close,5,-1']
        ```
        
        ### `style`
        
        ```
        style:<style>
        ```
        
        Gets a `bool`-type series whether the candlestick of a period is of `style` style
        
        - **style** `'bullish' | 'bearish'`
        
        ```py
        stock['style:bullish']
        ```
        
        ### `repeat`
        
        ```
        repeat:(<bool_directive>),<repeat>
        ```
        
        The `repeat` command first gets the result of directive `bool_directive`, and detect whether `True` is repeated for `repeat` times
        
        - **bool_directive** `str` the directive which should returns a series of `bool`s. PAY ATTENTION, that the directive should be wrapped with parantheses as a parameter.
        - **repeat?** `int=1` which should be larger than `0`
        
        ```py
        # Whether the bullish candlestick repeats for 3 periods (maybe 3 days)
        stock['repeat:(style:bullish),3']
        ```
        
        ## Operators
        
        ```
        left operator right
        ```
        
        - **`/`**: whether `left` crosses through `right` from the down side of `right` to the upper side which we call it as "cross up".
        - **`\`**: whether `left` crosses down `right`.
        - **`><`**: whether `left` crosses `right`, either up or down.
        - **`<`** / **`<=`** / **`==`** / **`>=`** / **`>`**: For a certain record of the same time, whether the value of `left` is less than / less than or equal to / equal to / larger than or equal to / larger than the value of `right`.
        
        ## Errors
        
        ```py
        from stock_pandas import (
            DirectiveSyntaxError,
            DirectiveValueError
        )
        ```
        
        ### `DirectiveSyntaxError`
        
        Raises if there is a syntax error in the given directive.
        
        ```py
        stock['''
        repeat
            :
                (
                    column:close >> boll.upper
                ),
                5
        ''']
        ```
        
        `DirectiveSyntaxError` might print some messages like this:
        
        ```
        File "<string>", line 5, column 26
        
           repeat
               :
                   (
        >              column:close >> boll.upper
                   ),
                   5
        
                                    ^
        DirectiveSyntaxError: ">>" is an invalid operator
        ```
        
        ### `DirectiveValueError`
        
        Raises if
        - there is an unknown command name
        - something is wrong about the command arguments
        - etc.
