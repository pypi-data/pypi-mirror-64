PyTorch framework for RL research.
It was developed with a focus on reproducibility,
fast experimentation and code/ideas reusing.
Being able to research/develop something new,
rather than write another regular train loop. <br/>
Break the cycle - use the Catalyst!

## Installation

Common installation:
```bash
pip install -U catalyst-rl
```

Catalyst.RL is compatible with: Python 3.6+. PyTorch 1.0.0+.

API documentation and an overview of the library can be found here
[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?label=docs&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.org%2Fpypi%2Fcatalyst%2Fjson&query=%24.info.version&colorB=brightgreen&prefix=v)](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/index.html). <br/>
In the **[examples folder](examples)**
of the repository, you can find advanced tutorials and Catalyst best practices.

##### Infos
To learn more about Catalyst internals and to be aware of the most important features, you can read **[Catalyst-info](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst-info)** – our blog where we regularly write facts about the framework.

We also supervise **[Awesome Catalyst list](https://github.com/catalyst-team/awesome-catalyst-list)** – Catalyst-powered projects, tutorials and talks. <br/>
Feel free to make a PR with your project to the list. And don't forget to check out current list, there are many interesting projects.

##### Releases
We deploy a major release once a month with a name like `YY.MM`. <br/>
And micro-releases with framework improvements during a month in the format `YY.MM.#`.

You can view the changelog on the **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/releases)** page. <br/>
Current version: [![Pipi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/catalyst.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/catalyst/)


## Overview

Catalyst.RL helps you write compact
but full-featured RL pipelines in a few lines of code.
You get a training loop with metrics, early-stopping, model checkpointing
and other features without the boilerplate.

#### Features

- Universal train/inference loop.
- Configuration files for model/data hyperparameters.
- Reproducibility – all source code and environment variables will be saved.
- Callbacks – reusable train/inference pipeline parts.
- Training stages support.
- Easy customization.
- PyTorch best practices (SWA, AdamW, Ranger optimizer, OneCycle, FP16 and more).

#### Structure

- **RL** – scalable Reinforcement Learning,
   all popular model-free algorithms implementations and their improvements
   with distributed training support.
- **contrib** - additional modules contributed by Catalyst users.
- **utils** - different useful utils for Deep Learning research.
