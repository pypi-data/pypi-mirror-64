#+TITLE: jaglar

Tool for project management backed by [[https://taskjuggler.org/][tj]].

We have been using a few project management tools like [[https://ganttpro.com/][ganttpro]], [[https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira][jira]] but the
features aren't sufficient or are hard to flex programmatically. In jaglar we
attempt to map data from these other tools to [[https://taskjuggler.org/][taskjuggler]] which provides much
more control over what we can do.

** Quickstart
=jaglar= is on pypi so you need to do =pip install jaglar=.

While the scripts here are pretty much custom built for our own purpose, you can
try inspecting a few examples in ~./examples~ directory which are targeted at
generating gantt charts after running tj's resource allocation.

Basic idea is to have a set of intermediate types (=jaglar.types=) for project
management pieces which can then be generated from other tool exports and be
converted to tj format.
