Description: # Sharp-Darwin
        Python CLI Spotify utility.
        
        ## Why?
        Why "sharp-darwin"? Why not? I have huge creativity when naming things, so I picked two incredible words to pair for your enjoyment.
        
        ## Purpose
        This project started with a need to consolidate my Spotify playlists. I keep monthly playlists of the things I like. After three years of Spotify monthly playlist making... I have a lot of playlists. My goal was to consolidate the lists into quarterly (most recent lists), half year, and year playlists (oldest lists).
        
        ## Getting Started
        1. Install sharp-darwin from PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/sharp-darwin/ ```pip install sharp-darwin```
        2. Next, you'll need to set up your own Spotify app: https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications
        3. Create a new app, or reuse an existing. If creating a new app, provide at least the required fields.. whatever you want. After creation, click *Edit Settings*. In the *Redirect URIs* field, simply enter `https://localhost`.
        4. On the main app page, you'll need to fetch the *Client ID* and *Client Secret*.
        5. Set up envionmental vars as indicated in the below section.
        6. Run the app! ```sharp-darwin --help```.
        
        ## Environmental Variables
        Sharp-Darwin can import configuration from envionmental variables or from a .env file. If you choose to use a .env file, you can specifiy the location of the file on the command line ```sharp-darwin --env /path/to/my/dot/env```.
        ### Variables
        Most items should be self-explanatory. Here's a few which are not:
        * SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI: set this to ```https://localhost``` to locallly fetch an OAuth token. If you know what you're doing, you know how to set this. Otherwise.. stick to the suggested.
        * SHARP_DARWIN_CRED_CACHE: this is the location of the Spotipy OAuth credential cache. It will default to the current working directoy if not set.
        
        Example ```.env``` file:
        ```
        SPOTIPY_USERNAME=you_spotify_username
        SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
        SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
        SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=https://localhost
        SHARP_DARWIN_CRED_CACHE=/path/to/cred/cache
        ```
