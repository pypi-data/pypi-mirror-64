# Sharp-Darwin
Python CLI Spotify utility.

## Why?
Why "sharp-darwin"? Why not? I have huge creativity when naming things, so I picked two incredible words to pair for your enjoyment.

## Purpose
This project started with a need to consolidate my Spotify playlists. I keep monthly playlists of the things I like. After three years of Spotify monthly playlist making... I have a lot of playlists. My goal was to consolidate the lists into quarterly (most recent lists), half year, and year playlists (oldest lists).

## Getting Started
This app requires a bit of set up. I've provided ```requirements.txt``` for Pip users and ```environment.yml``` for Anaconda users.
1. Clone/fork your own local copy.
2. Set up the environmant using [https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](pipenv) to set up a Python 3.7.x environment. Or use [https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file](Anaconda).
3. Next, you'll need to set up your own Spotify app: https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications
4. Create a new app, or reuse an existing. If creating a new app, provide at least the required fields.. whatever you want. After creation, click *Edit Settings*. In the *Redirect URIs* field, simply enter `https://localhost`.
5. On the main app page, you'll need to fetch the *Client ID* and *Client Secret*.
6. Back to the cloned code, `cp env.dist .env`
7. Edit *.env* and fill in fields with your username and the data fetched from the previously created/view Spotify App.
8. With all those steps complete, run the app!
