These codes was written by Jean-Baptiste Tanguy. There are several classes or functions callable but there
are not really related. It's just about making the programs more easily handled.

What do we have in this package?

* ```neural_language_model_char_based.py```: this allows to learn, load, save and use a neural character based language model
* ```simple_proba_language_model_char_based.py```: this allows to learn, load, save and use a simple statistical character based language model
* ```evaluate_ocr_results.py```: this allows to process several methods to evaluate an ocr result (cer, wer, language model).
