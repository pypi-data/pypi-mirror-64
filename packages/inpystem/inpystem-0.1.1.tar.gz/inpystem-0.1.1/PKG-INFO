Description: # inpystem python library
        
        ## Description
        
        inpystem is an open source Python library which provides tools to reconstruct partially sampled 2D images as multi-band images.
        
        inpystem's core is a set of reconstruction techniques such as interpolation, regularized least-square and dictionary learning methods. It provides a user interface which simplify the use of these techniques.
        
        inpystem is mainly at the destination of the microscopy community so that it highly depends on the good library [HyperSpy](https://hyperspy.org/).
        
        This library was originally developed by its creator Etienne Monier to handle EELS data and develop reconstruction algorithms. This was proposed afterwards to the microscopy community as a tool.
