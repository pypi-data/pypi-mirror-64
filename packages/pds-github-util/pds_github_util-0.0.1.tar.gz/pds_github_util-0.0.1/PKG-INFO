        Enforces the PDS engineering node software lifecycle
        
        # Prerequisites
        
        libxml2 is used. It needs to be deployed as follow:
        
        ## Macos
        
            brew install libxml2
            cd ./venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/  # chose the site package of the used python
            ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.9.10/lib/python3.7/site-packages/* .
        
        ## Ubuntu
        
            sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev
            pip install lxml
        
        # deploy and run
        
        Deploy:
        
            pip install pds-gihub-util
        
        Some environment variable need to be set (they are defined by default in github action but need to be set manually otherwise)
        
            export GITHUB_WORKSPACE=<where the repository which we want to publish a snapshot is cloned>
            export GITHUB_REPOSITORY=<full name of the repository which we want to publish for example NASA-PDS-Incubator/pds-app-registry>
        
        Run with, as parameter, the personal access token for github:
        
            snapshot-release --token <personal access token>
        
        
        # Development
         
            git clone ...
            cd pds-github-util
            python -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
            pip install -r requirements.txt
