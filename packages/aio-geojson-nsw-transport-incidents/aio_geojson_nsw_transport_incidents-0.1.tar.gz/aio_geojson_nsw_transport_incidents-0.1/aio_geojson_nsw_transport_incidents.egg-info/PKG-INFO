        [![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents)
        
        This library provides convenient async access to the [NSW Transport Service Live traffic status](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/live-traffic-site-status) incidents feed. 
        The feed can be seen online on (https://www.livetraffic.com/)
         
        ## Installation
        `pip install aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents`
        
        ## Usage
        See below for examples of how this library can be used. After instantiating a 
        particular class - feed or feed manager - and supply the required parameters, 
        you can call `update` to retrieve the feed data. The return value 
        will be a tuple of a status code and the actual data in the form of a list of 
        feed entries specific to the selected feed.
        
        Status Codes
        * _OK_: Update went fine and data was retrieved. The library may still 
          return empty data, for example because no entries fulfilled the filter 
          criteria.
        * _OK_NO_DATA_: Update went fine but no data was retrieved, for example 
          because the server indicated that there was not update since the last request.
        * _ERROR_: Something went wrong during the update
        
        **Parameters**
        
        | Parameter          | Description                               |
        |--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
        | `home_coordinates` | Coordinates (tuple of latitude/longitude) |
        | `feature`          | Type of Hazard to retreive                |
        
        Traffic Hazards are divided into six basic types:
        * Incidents (`incident-open` `incident-closed` `incident`)
        * Fire  (`fire-open` `fire-closed` `fire`)
        * Flood (`flood-open` `flood-closed` `flood`)
        * Alpine conditions (`alpine-open` `alpine-closed` `alpine`)
        * Major Events (`majorevent-open` `majorevent-closed` `majorevent`)
        * Roadworks (`roadwork-open` `roadwork-closed` `roadwork`)
        
        Hazards can be open, closed (or both can be retreived). Refer to the [Live Traffic Data Developer Guide](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/Live_Traffic_Data_Developer_Guide.pdf)
        
        **Supported Filters**
        
        | Filter     |                     | Description |
        |------------|---------------------|-------------|
        | Radius     | `filter_radius`     | Radius in kilometers around the home coordinates in which events from feed are included. |
        | Categories | `filter_categories` | Array of category names. Only events with a category matching any of these is included. |
        
        **Example**
        ```python
        import asyncio
        from aiohttp import ClientSession
        from aio_geojson_nsw_transport_incidents import NswTransportServiceIncidentsFeed
        async def main() -> None:
            async with ClientSession() as websession:    
                # Home Coordinates: Latitude: -33.0, Longitude: 150.0
                # Filter radius: 50 km
                # Filter categories: 'Scheduled roadwork'
                # Hazard type : 'roadworks-open'
                feed = NswTransportServiceIncidentsFeed(websession, 
                                                        (-33.0, 150.0), 
                                                        filter_radius=50, 
                                                        filter_categories=['Scheduled roadwork'],
                                                        hazard="roadwork-open")
                status, entries = await feed.update()
                print(status)
                print(entries)
        asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
        ```

        | description        | The description of the incident.                                                                    | `headline`  |
        | council_area       | Council are this incident falls into.                                                               | `roads` -> `suburb`        |
        | road               | Council are this incident falls into.                                                               | `roads` -> `mainStreet`        |

        | diversions         | The Summary of any traffic diversions in place. The text may contain HTML markup..                  | `diversions`        |
        | subCategory        | The sub-category of incident of this entry.                                                         | `subCategory`        |
        | duration           | The Planned duration of the hazard. This property is rarely used.                                   | `duration`        |
        
        
        ## Feed Manager
        
        The Feed Manager helps managing feed updates over time, by notifying the 
        consumer of the feed about new feed entries, updates and removed entries 
        compared to the last feed update.
        
        * If the current feed update is the first one, then all feed entries will be 
          reported as new. The feed manager will keep track of all feed entries' 
          external IDs that it has successfully processed.
        * If the current feed update is not the first one, then the feed manager will 
          produce three sets:
          * Feed entries that were not in the previous feed update but are in the 
            current feed update will be reported as new.
          * Feed entries that were in the previous feed update and are still in the 
            current feed update will be reported as to be updated.
          * Feed entries that were in the previous feed update but are not in the 
            current feed update will be reported to be removed.
        * If the current update fails, then all feed entries processed in the previous
          feed update will be reported to be removed.
        
        After a successful update from the feed, the feed manager provides two
        different dates:
        
        * `last_update` will be the timestamp of the last update from the feed 
          irrespective of whether it was successful or not.
        * `last_update_successful` will be the timestamp of the last successful update 
          from the feed. This date may be useful if the consumer of this library wants 
          to treat intermittent errors from feed updates differently.
        * `last_timestamp` (optional, depends on the feed data) will be the latest 
          timestamp extracted from the feed data. 
          This requires that the underlying feed data actually contains a suitable 
          date. This date may be useful if the consumer of this library wants to 
          process feed entries differently if they haven't actually been updated.
        
        
        ## Attribution and motivation
        This is a fork of [exxamalte/python-aio-geojson-nsw-rfs-incidents](https://github.com/exxamalte/python-aio-geojson-nsw-rfs-incidents). 
        It deferes mainly as the geoJSON feeds generated by NSW Transport using QGis.  QGis generates files that don't match exactly geojson format (geometry types : `POINT` instead of `Point`)
        
        This library has been created for [Home Assistant component](https://github.com/Fred-Ch/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/nsw_transport_incident_service_feed).
