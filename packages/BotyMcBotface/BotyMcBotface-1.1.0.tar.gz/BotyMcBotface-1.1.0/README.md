# BotyMcBotface

An example IRC bot skeleton written in Python 3.

## Introduction

BotyMcBotface (because what else can you name a bot, really?) is a
simple IRC bot skeleton inspired by the tutorial at
https://pythonspot.com/en/building-an-irc-bot. This skeleton doesn't
really do anything; it was designed as an example of how to write a
bot that others can build upon.

## Files

There are basically two files - the actual IRC code in the file
**botymcbotface/irc.py**, and an example bot, **example_bot.py**. The
latter has plenty of comments, and should probably be the first one
you look at. The other one, **botymcbotface/irc.py** should be usable
as-is, but it's pretty bare-bones as of now. However, to make your own
bot, changing **example_bot.py** should be enough.

## Setup

To make this work, you first need to register your own version of the
bot's nickname on Freenode:
http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-Nickname-on-Freenode

Then, you put two files in a directory called **private** inside the
same directory as the code, one called **nickname** which contains the
nickname you registered, and one called **password** which
unsurprisingly should contain the password. Having done that, you
should be able to just start **example_bot.py** to get it running.
Read its code and comments for more in-depth information of how it
works.
