Description: # tf-argonaut
        
        Library for creating visual experiment pipelines in tensorflow. Allows to test out different network concepts against standardized datasets.
        
        > The Argonauts where a band of heros and adventures that sailed on their ship Argo through the mediterranean and navigated numerous adventures.
        > Like one of them this library is designed to turn TF into your own argo and navigate your experiments.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        To install the library simply use PyPi:
        ```
        pip3 install tf-argonaut
        ```
        
        Alternatively you can install the library directly through `setup.py`:
        ```
        pip3 install .
        ```
        
        You can then import the library:
        ```python
        import argonaut as argo
        ```

        ## Concepts
        
        Concepts include:
        
        * Experiments
        * Pipeline
        * Datasets
        * Callbacks
        
        ### Tools
        
        The library also contains multiple tools that allow to inspect data and quickly start training processes.
