def signal_binarize(signal, threshold="auto"):
    """Binarize a continuous signal.

    Convert a continuous signal into zeros and ones depending on a given threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : list, array or Series
        The signal channel in the form of a vector of values.
    threshold : float
        The threshold value by which to select the events. If "auto", takes the value between the max and the min.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        A list or array depending on the type passed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import neurokit2 as nk
    >>>
    >>> signal = np.cos(np.linspace(start=0, stop=20, num=1000))
    >>> binary = nk.signal_binarize(signal)
    >>> pd.DataFrame({"Raw": signal, "Binary": binary}).plot()
