Description: hammett
        =======
        
        hammett is a fast python test runner that is largely compatible with pytest.
        
        It does not support class based tests at this time though.
        
        
        Usage
        ------
        
        First install: :code:`pip install hammett`
        
        Then run hammett: :code:`python -m hammett`
        
        Hopefully it will run your entire test suite!
        
        hammett works with some pytest plugins, most notably pytest-django, at least for some projects.
