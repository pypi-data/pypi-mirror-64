Description: # [optcutfreq](https://pypi.org/project/optcutfreq)
        
        Automatic search of optimal filter cutoff frequency based on residual analysis
        
        The 'optimal' cutoff frequency (in the sense that a filter with such cutoff frequency removes as much noise as possible without considerably affecting the signal) is found by performing a residual analysis of the difference between filtered and unfiltered signals over a range of cutoff frequencies.  
        The optimal cutoff frequency is the one where the residual starts to change very little because it is considered that from this point, it's being filtered mostly noise and minimally signal, ideally.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install optcutfreq
        ```
        
        Or
        
        ```bash
        conda install -c duartexyz optcutfreq
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        
        ```python
        >>> y = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(1000))
        >>> # optimal cutoff frequency based on residual analysis and plot:
        >>> fc_opt = optcutfreq(y, freq=1000, show=True)
        
        >>> # sane analysis but specifying the frequency limits and plot:
        >>> optcutfreq(y, freq=1000, fclim=[200,400], show=True)
        
        >>> # It's not always possible to find an optimal cutoff frequency
        >>> # or the one found can be wrong (run this example many times):
        >>> y = np.random.randn(100)
        >>> optcutfreq(y, freq=100, show=True)
        ```
