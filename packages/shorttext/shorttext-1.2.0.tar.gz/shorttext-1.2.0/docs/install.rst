Installation
============

PIP
---

Package `shorttext` runs in Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7. However, for Python 3.7, the backend
of keras_ cannot be Tensorflow_.

To install the package in Linux or OS X, enter the following in the console:

::

   pip install -U shorttext

It is very possible that you have to do it as root, that you have to add ``sudo`` in
front of the command.

On the other hand, to get the development version on Github, you can install from Github_:

::

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/stephenhky/PyShortTextCategorization@master

By adding ``-U`` in the command, it automatically installs the required packages. If not,
you have to install these packages on your own.

Before using, check the language model of spaCy has been installed or updated, by running:

::

    python -m spacy download en


Backend for Keras
-----------------

The package keras_ (version >= 2.0.0) uses either Tensorflow_, Theano_, or CNTK_ as the backend, while Theano is usually
the default. However, it is highly recommended to use Tensorflow as the backend.
Users are advised to install the backend Tensorflow_ (preferred for Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6) or
Theano_ (preferred for Python 3.7) in advance. Refer to
:doc:`faq` for how to switch the backend. It is also desirable if the package Cython_ has been previously installed.


Possible Solutions for Installation Failures
--------------------------------------------

Most developers can install `shorttext` with the instructions above. If the installation fails,
you may try one (or more) of the following:

1. Installing Python-dev by typing:

::

    pip install -U python-dev



for Python 2.7, or

::

    pip install -U python3-dev


for Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.

2. Installing `gcc` by entering

::

    apt-get install libc6
