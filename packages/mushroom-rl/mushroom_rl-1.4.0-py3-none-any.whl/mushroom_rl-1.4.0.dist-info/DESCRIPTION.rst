Mushroom is a Python Reinforcement Learning (RL) library whose modularity allows to easily use well-known Python libraries for tensor computation (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow) and RL benchmarks (e.g. OpenAI Gym, PyBullet, Deepmind Control Suite). It allows to perform RL experiments in a simple way providing classical RL algorithms (e.g. Q-Learning, SARSA, FQI), and deep RL algorithms (e.g. DQN, DDPG, SAC, TD3, TRPO, PPO).
