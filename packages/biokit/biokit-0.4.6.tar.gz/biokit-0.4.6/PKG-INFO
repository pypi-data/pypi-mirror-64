        Contents
        ===============
        
        BioKit is a set of tools gathered from several other Python packages. The goal
        is to gather tools that should be useful to develop computational biology
        software. Biokit contains a few plotting tools (viz module), some statistical
        analysis (mixture model), some tools to access to Taxon and GO identifier, some basic tools to manipulate sequences and so on. It is linked to BioServices package to provide access to biological resources. Lots of biological software are developed in R. We have also added a module to ease the installation and usage of R tools within BioKit.
        
        **WARNING**: This package is maintained and used in production but its
        contents are moving slowly to another project called sequana
        (sequana.readthedocs.io) (.e.g mixture model from biokit.stats and biokit.viz
        will most probably be moved in the current of 2020).
        
        Installation
        ==============
