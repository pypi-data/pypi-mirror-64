# IBM COS Resource Configuration SDK for Python 

This package allows Python developers to write software that interacts with the Resource Configuration API for [IBM
Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cos/cos-configuration).

## Notice

IBM is officially deprecating support of Python versions 2.7 & 3.4.   All clients need to upgrade to version 3.5 or greater by January 31, 2020.

## Documentation

* [Core documentation for IBM COS](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/getting-started.html)
* [REST API Reference and Code Examples](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cos/cos-configuration)
* [Python Resource Configuration API reference documentation](https://ibm.github.io/ibm-cos-sdk-python-config)

For release notes, see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick start

You'll need:
  * An instance of COS.
  * An API key from [IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam/users_roles.html).
  * **Python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7**.

  These values can be found in the IBM Cloud Console by [generating a 'service credential'](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/iam/service-credentials.html).

## Getting the SDK
