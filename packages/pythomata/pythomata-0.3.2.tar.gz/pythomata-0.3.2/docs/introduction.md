# Introduction

Pythomata provides support for automata theory to
the Python programming language. It consists of an
implementation-agnostic interface for a generic finite automaton,
some implementations of that interface, and other programming utilities
for rendering and serialization/deserialization.

In the [Install](./install.md) page you
will find the installation instructions.

Please have a look to the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md)
guide to get it started.
