Description: # mplsoccer
        mplsoccer is a Python plotting library for drawing soccer / football pitches quickly in Matplotlib.
        
        mplsoccer currently supports several data formats:
        - Opta
        - Tracab (ChyronHego) tracking data
        - Statsbomb
        - STATS (formerly Prozone)
        - Wyscout (the pitch dimensions are taken from ggsoccer: https://github.com/Torvaney/ggsoccer)
        
        The following example draws an Opta pitch (the default) with stripes.
        ``` python
        from mplsoccer.pitch import Pitch
        pitch = Pitch(orientation='horizontal',figsize=(10,10),stripe=True)
        fig, ax = pitch.draw()
        fig.savefig('opta.png',pad_inches=0,bbox_inches='tight')
        ```
        ![alt text](https://github.com/andrewRowlinson/mplsoccer/blob/master/docs/figures/README_example_opta_pitch.png?raw=true "pitch xkcd style")
        
        For fun you can also plot the same pitch in xkcd mode.
        ``` python
        from mplsoccer.pitch import Pitch
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.xkcd()
        pitch = Pitch(orientation='horizontal',figsize=(10,10),stripe=True)
        fig, ax = pitch.draw()
        fig.savefig('opta_xkcd.png',pad_inches=0,bbox_inches='tight')
        ```

        # This library is under development
        The following developments are planned
        - rotation of scatter plot markers
        - create pass map methods
        - add examples (team line-up / pass maps/ pressure maps/ subplots)
        - add method for plotting Voronoi diagrams
        - create documentation using Sphinx
