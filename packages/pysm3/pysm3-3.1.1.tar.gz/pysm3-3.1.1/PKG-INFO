        # PySM 3
        
        PySM generates full-sky simulations of Galactic emissions in intensity and polarization relevant to CMB experiments.
        It is a large refactor of [PySM 2](https://github.com/bthorne93/PySM_public) focused on reducing memory usage,
        improving performance and run in parallel with MPI.
        
        See the documentation at <https://pysm3.readthedocs.io>
        
        ## Install
        
        ### Requirements
        
        See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
        
        ### Conda
        
            conda install -c conda-forge pysm3
        
        See the [conda repository](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pysm3) and the [feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/pysm3-feedstock)
        
        ### Pip
        
            pip install pysm3
        
        ### Libsharp
        
        MPI-Distributed smoothing (optional) requires `libsharp`, it is easiest to install the conda package:
        
            conda install -c conda-forge libsharp=*=*openmpi*
        
        It also has a `mpich` version:
        
            conda install -c conda-forge libsharp=*=*mpich*
        
Platform: UNKNOWN
Requires-Python: >=3.5
