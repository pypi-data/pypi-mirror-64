* Built-in support for Disqus, google analytics, navigation bar, social sharing, mathjax and code highlighting.
* Support for spell checking, live server and generation of RSS/Atom feeds.
* Blog management: updating the index file, parsing out images, managing topics and metadata.
* Write and post blogs from android or any microdevice. All that is required is command line with python and pip.
* Built-in design, blog_templates for rapidly setting up your blog from scratch.
* Fully customizable with support for custom themes and templates.

## 💻 Installation

### Recommended Method
```
$ curl -sSL https://hemanta212.github.io/blogger-cli/get_blogger.py | python
```
Since blogger has a lot of dependencies (nbconvert, jupyter), this custom installer will install them in a virtual environment and add it to your path for global access.

### Using pip
```
pip install blogger-cli
```

If you mainly use jupyter notebooks, then you already have all the required dependencies although it is recommended to use `virtual environments`.


## 🚀 Getting Started
Make a website repository and clone it to your computer. Now register your blog name with blogger
```$ blogger addblog <blogname>```
and set up the necessary configs. Now, If you have a new site or an empty site. You can get blogger default design and boilerplate.
```
$ blogger export blog_layout -b <blogname>
```
Now, all assets will be moved to the blog_dir you specified in the blog config during setup.
```
$ blogger serve <blogname>
```
Open the URL http://localhost:8000/ in your browser to view your blog!!
