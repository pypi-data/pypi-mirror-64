## üíª Installation

### Recommended Method
```
$ curl -sSL https://hemanta212.github.io/blogger-cli/get_blogger.py | python
```
Since blogger has a lot of dependencies (nbconvert, jupyter), this custom installer will install them in a virtual environment and add it to your path for global access.

### Using pip
```
pip install blogger-cli
```

If you mainly use jupyter notebooks, then you already have all the required dependencies although it is recommended to use `virtual environments`.

```$ blogger addblog <blogname>```
and set up the necessary configs. Now, If you have a new site or an empty site. You can get blogger default design and boilerplate.
```
$ blogger export blog_layout -b <blogname>
```
Now, all assets will be moved to the blog_dir you specified in the blog config during setup.
```
$ blogger serve <blogname>
```
Open the URL http://localhost:8000/ in your browser to view your blog!!
