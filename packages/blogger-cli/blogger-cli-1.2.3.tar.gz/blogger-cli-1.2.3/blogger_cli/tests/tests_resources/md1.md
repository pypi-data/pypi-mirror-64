```
import os

os.path.join(a, b)
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```
```
help(os.path.abspath)
```
```
abspath(path)
    Return the absolute version of a path.
```

See ? It just works out of the box for me!!

```
def test_width_management(width=20):
    for i in range(50):
        print(i, "Cycle of loop has been succesfully completed")

test_width_management()
```
