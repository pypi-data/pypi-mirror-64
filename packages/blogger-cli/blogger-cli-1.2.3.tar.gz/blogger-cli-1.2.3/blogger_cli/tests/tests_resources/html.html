            <h1>How I built a Command line app to manage my blog</h1>
<h2>Why to do it?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have to write code in jupyternotebook and md files</li>
<li>I need custom easy solution that is fast</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>import os

os.path.join(a, b)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
</code></pre>

<pre><code>help(os.path.abspath)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>abspath(path)
    Return the absolute version of a path.
</code></pre>

<p>See ? It just works out of the box for me!!</p>
<pre><code>def test_width_management(width=20):
    for i in range(50):
        print(i, &quot;Cycle of loop has been succesfully completed&quot;)

test_width_management()
</code></pre>
