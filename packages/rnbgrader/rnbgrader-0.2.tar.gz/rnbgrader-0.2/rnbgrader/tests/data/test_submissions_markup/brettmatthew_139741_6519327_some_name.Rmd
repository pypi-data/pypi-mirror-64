This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.

Show the names of the columns in the `cars` data frame:

```{r}
names(cars)
```

Show the number of rows and columns:

```{r}
#- Use "dim" to show the number of rows and columns of the "cars"
#- data frame.
#- 5 marks / 40 (total 5 so far).
dim(cars)
```

Show the structure of the `cars` data frame:

```{r}
#- Show the structure of the cars data frame
#- 5 marks / 40 (total 10 so far).
str(cars)
#M: -2
```

Show the first 6 cars (rows) in the data frame using the `head` function:

```{r}
#- Show the first 6 cars with the "head" function.
#- 5 marks / 40 (total 15 so far).
head(cars)
```


```{r}
#- Do a histogram of the speeks
#- 10 marks / 40 (total 25 so far).
hist(cars$speed)
```

Use the `table` function to the counts of the various speeds.

```{r}
#- Use "table" to show the counts of cars with each speed value.
#- 5 marks / 40 (total 30 so far).
table(cars$speed)
```

Make a new data frame containing the rows with speeds less than 15:

```{r}
#M: 42
#- Make a new data frame called "fast" containing only the cars
#- with speeds greater than 15.  Use the subset command.
#- Then, use "head" to check that you have cars faster than 15.
#- 10 marks / 40 (total 40 so far).
fast <- subset(cars, cars$speed > 15)
head(fast)
```

That's it.
