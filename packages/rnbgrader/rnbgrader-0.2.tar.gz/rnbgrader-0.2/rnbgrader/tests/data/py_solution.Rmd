This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook, in Python.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
# %matplotlib inline

# Load the cars data frame
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')
```

Show the names of the columns in the `cars` data frame:

```{python}
list(cars)
```

Show the number of rows and columns:

```{python}
#- Show the number of rows and columns of the "cars"
#- data frame.
#- 5 marks / 50 (total 5 so far).
cars.shape
```

Show the structure of the `cars` data frame:

```{python}
#- Show the structure of the cars data frame
#- 5 marks / 50 (total 10 so far).
cars.info()
```

Show the first 6 cars (rows) in the data frame using the `head` method:

```{python}
#- Show the first 5 cars with the "head" method.
#- 5 marks / 50 (total 15 so far).
cars.head()
```

Show a histogram of the `speed` column of the `cars` data frame:

```{python}
#- Do a histogram of the speeks
#- 10 marks / 50 (total 25 so far).
cars['speed'].hist()
```

Use the `value_counts` method to show the counts of the various speeds.

```{python}
#- Use "value_counts" to show the counts of cars with each speed value.
#- 5 marks / 50 (total 30 so far).
cars['speed'].value_counts()
```

Make a new data frame containing the rows with speeds less than 15:

```{python}
#- Make a new data frame called "fast" containing only the cars
#- with speeds greater than 15.  Use the subset command.
#- Then, use "head" to check that you have cars faster than 15.
#- 10 marks / 50 (total 40 so far).
fast = cars[cars['speed'] > 15]
fast.head()
```

Finally, do a histogram of the `dist` column of the `fast` data frame:

```{python}
#- Do a histogram of the dist column.
#- 10 marks / 50 (total 50 so far).
fast['dist'].hist()
```

That's it.
