A list:

  * Here is a list item with a code chunk:
  
    ```{r}
    a = 1
    a
    ```

A numbered list:

  1. Here is a list item with a code chunk:
  
    ```{r}
    b = 2
    b
    ```
     The list continues, but this chunk has irregular indentation:

    ```{r}
c = 3
  c
    ```

    More of the list, but this one doesn't close properly:
    ```{r}
    c
  ```
    So the block continues through the next code chunk
    ```{r}
    a
    ```
The end.
