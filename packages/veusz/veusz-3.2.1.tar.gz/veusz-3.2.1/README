Veusz 3.2.1
-----------
https://veusz.github.io

Veusz is a 2D and 3D scientific plotting package.  It is designed to
produce publication-ready PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up by
combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 3.2.1:
 Bug fixes:
  * Fix too large page size in SVG export
  * Reenable compression for PNG export
  * Fix crash in HDF5 import dialog
  * If filename extension is missing in export dialog, add it
    and avoid crash
  * Take account of QT_LIBINFIX setting for unusual Qt installs

 Improvements:
  * Add \wtilde text command to place a tilde over text

Changes in 3.2:
 Improvements:
  * Add ability to plot image widget using boxes rather than a bitmap,
    with new drawing mode option
  * Add widget order option in key widget
  * Export dialog now uses multiple threads
  * Python 3.9 compatibility fixes

 Minor changes:
  * Show exception dialog if crash occurs outside main thread
