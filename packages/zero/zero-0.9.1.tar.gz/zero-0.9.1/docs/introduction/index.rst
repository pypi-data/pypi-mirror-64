Introduction
============

Circuit analyses with |Zero| revolve around building a :ref:`circuit <circuit/index:Circuits>` from
:ref:`components <components/index:Components>` and applying an :ref:`analysis <analyses/index:Analyses>`.
The output from an analysis is a :ref:`solution <solution/index:Solutions>`, with which the results
can be plotted or saved.

|Zero| can be used either as a Python library or using its :ref:`command line interface <cli/index:Command line interface>`.
|Zero| also somewhat understands LISO input and output files (see :ref:`liso/index:LISO Compatibility`).
