Gets data for CoronaVirus (COVID-19) using John Hopkins' ArcGIS application layer  https://services1.arcgis.com/0MSEUqKaxRlEPj5g/ArcGIS/rest/services/ncov_cases/FeatureServer using a query to return a JSON document, so unlike similar packages it does not rely on a datasheet that is might not be up to date, but queries the source database directly. This allows us to get the most up to date information that is currently available
