Description: **featureimpact** let's you compute the statistical impact of features given
        a trained estimator. The computation is based on the mean variation
        of the difference between perturbed and original predictions. The estimator must
        predict purely numerical values. All features must also consist of purely
        numerical values.
        
        Example:
        ```
        from featureimpact import FeatureImpact
        fi = FeatureImpact()
        fi.make_quantiles(X_train)
        impact = fi.compute_impact(model, X_test)
        ```
        
        Note: In order to run the examples you'll need scikit-learn
        installed in addition to this package and its regular dependencies.
        
        The algorithm is described here:
