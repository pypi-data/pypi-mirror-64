# Docker Interface [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spotify/docker_interface.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spotify/docker_interface) ![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-beta-orange.svg)

Docker Interface (DI) is a declarative interface for building images and running commands in containers using Docker. At Spotify, we use Docker Interface to minimise environment drift by running all of our code in containersâ€“during development, production, or to train machine learning models.

## Installing Docker Interface

You can install Docker Interface using the following `pip` command (you need a python3 interpreter).

```
pip install docker-interface
```

To check that Docker Interface was installed successfully, run
```
di --help
```

## Using Docker Interface

Docker Interface can be invoked from the command line. By default, it reads the configuration from the file `di.yml` in the current working directory, a basic version of which is shown below.

```yaml
build:
  tag: name-of-your-image
```

Docker interface supports two commands:

* `build` builds and tags Docker image using the current working directory as the build context.
* `run` runs a Docker command in a container and mounts the current working directory with appropriate permissions at `/workspace` so you can access your local files without having to rebuild the image.

You can find more extensive examples in the [`examples` folder](https://github.com/spotify/docker_interface/tree/master/examples) in this repository. You can find more detailed information [here](http://docker-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Check the [schema](http://docker-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schema.html) to get a comprehensive overview of the declarative syntax supported by Docker Interface.

## Contributing to Docker Interface

To contribute to the development of Docker Interface, please create a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the repository and send any changes as a pull request.

You can test your local installation of Docker Interface as follows.

```
# 0. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
# 1. Install development requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. Run the tests
make tests
```

See [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [`conda`](https://conda.io/docs/) for details on how to set up a virtual environment in step 0.
