# AARC G002 Entitlement Parser

# Introduction
As part of the AARC Project several recommendations were made. G002
https://aarc-project.eu/guidelines/aarc-g002 describes encoding group
membership in entitlements.

This package provides a python Class to parse and compare such entitlements.

# Example

```
from aarc_g002_entitlement import Aarc_g002_entitlement

required_group= 'urn:geant:h-df.de:group:aai-admin'
actual_group  = 'urn:geant:h-df.de:group:aai-admin:role=member#backupserver.used.for.developmt.de'

required_entitlement = Aarc_g002_entitlement(required_group, strict=False)
actual_entitlement   = Aarc_g002_entitlement(actual_group)

print('    is_contained_in:   => {}'.format(required_entitlement.is_contained_in(actual_entitlement)))
print('        (are equal:    => {})'.format(required_entitlement == actual_entitlement))
```


For more examples: `./example.py`

# Installation
```
pip --user install aarc-g002-entitlement
```

# Note

This code allows an intentional exception from implementing the standard:
AARC-G002 makes the issuing authority mandatory (non-empty-string).
However, admins that specify the required entitlement don't care about
specifying the authority.
Therefore, the code allows a laxer handling, in that it does
accept entitlements that don't specify an authority, if the "strict=False"
argument is passed.

# Funding Notice
