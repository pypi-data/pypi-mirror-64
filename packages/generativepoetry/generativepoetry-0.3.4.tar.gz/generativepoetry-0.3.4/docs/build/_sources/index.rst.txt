Colab (recommended for most)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
You can install this software and launch the interactive menu for creating visual poems from the following `link <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eNTBSLMPpemYQq4n3keKCjVpw_JqY6w->`_ to a Jupyter notebook hosted on Google Colab.

Note: this will only work on desktop and tablet effectively because of screen-size issues. Keep this readme open to consult for reference.

On Your Computer
""""""""""""""""

Alternatively, if you install this on your own machine (see below), you can initalize the interactive menu by running the following command from a terminal/shell: generative-poetry-cli

Installation
""""""""""""

Windows
"""""""

Because this library currently relies on the Python package hunspell, which does not support Windows, use Docker to launch a Linux-based container, then use pip to install, and enter the Python interactive shell within:

.. code-block::

   docker run -t -d python python3 -m pip install generativepoetry && python3

OSX
"""

OSX users must install hunspell beforehand:

.. code-block::

   brew install hunspell

Then download the en_US dictionary from http://wordlist.aspell.net/dicts/ and unzip it to /Library/Spelling/ and install using pip:

.. code-block::

   python3 -m pip install generativepoetry

You will also need Microsoft's core font TTF files in /Library/Fonts/.

Linux
"""""

Ubuntu/Debian users should install hunspell-en-us and libhunspell-dev beforehand and then install with pip:

.. code-block::

   sudo apt-get install hunspell-en-us libhunspell-dev
   python3 -m pip install generativepoetry
