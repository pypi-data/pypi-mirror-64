Rationale for this is described [here](https://github.com/groupbwt/scrapy-boilerplate#file-and-folder-structure).\n\n## Usage\n\nThis is a scrapy command to generate class files and automatically add imports to respective module's `__init__` files. It can be used as follows:\n\n```\nscrapy new spider SampleSpider\n```\n\nThe first argument (`spider`) is a type of class file to be generated, and can be one of the following:\n\n- command\n- extension\n- item\n- middleware\n- model\n- pipeline\n- spider_middleware\n- spider\n\nThe second argument is class name.\n\nAlso for `pipeline` and `spider` class an option `--rabbit` can be used to add RabbitMQ connection code to generated source.\n\nOption `--item` with value `CLASSNAME` is supported for generating pipelines, which adds an import and type-check for a provided item class to the resulting code.\n\nOption `--settings` is also supported for pipelines, with an optional integer value `PRIORITY` that adds the pipeline being generated to scrapy `settings.py` file with specified priority (default 300).\n\n## Installation\n\nThis command is included in the [Scrapy Boilerplate](https://github.com/groupbwt/scrapy-boilerplate) out of the box. If you want to install it manually, you can get it from PyPi:\n\n```\npip install scrapy-new\n```\n\n**Please note** that this package won't work with default Scrapy project structure, it requires a specific custom one, as described [here](https://github.com/groupbwt/scrapy-boilerplate#file-and-folder-structure).\n",
