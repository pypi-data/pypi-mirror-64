Description: Pączek filler
        ============
        
        This tool tries to fill in a space next to `cookiecutter`, giving the user ability to
        reuse functionality stored in a single file across different projects.
        
        Setup a folder with files you reuse in your project.
        Set the `PACZEK_FILLINGS` environment variable to point that folder.
        Run `paczek` - will display list of files from which you can choose a file
        that will be put in your current directory. 
        If the file ends with `.tpl` you will be asked for values that will be put inside
        the template.
         
        Please remember, redundancy can be removed and files can me merged
        using git. 
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf Fuzzy Search for command line
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        There are two commands:
        - `paczek`
        - `paczekfiller <template_filepath> <target_filepath>`
        
        ### paczek
        
        `paczek` is a script that uses `fzf` to fill out a template, from your template's folder and save it in your current folder.
        
        If a template file ends with `.tpl`, then it is passed to `paczekfiller`, with the output filename without the `.tpl` extension.
        
        If template file is without `.tpl`, then it's copied to your current folder, using `cp`
        
        
        ### paczekfiller
        
        `paczekfiller` fills out a jinja2 template file and saves it under given target filepath.
        
        `<template_filepath>` is an absolute path.
        
        ### config
        
        Environment variables used by command `paczek`:
        
        * `PACZEK_FILLINGS`    stores path to folder with template files 
        * `PACZEK_GIT_SAFE`  set to `1` or whatever, when in folder with enabled git, paczek will checkout current branch and then place file 
        
        ### templates
        
        Variables are extracted from templates. Variables names are
        used in user prompt. The "_" are changed into spaces (" ").
        
        So, for a variable `{{Some_variable}}`, script will prompt user with
        this: `Some variable: `
        
        Installation
