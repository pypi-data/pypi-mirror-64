enviable
========

:author: Keryn Knight
:version: 0.2.2

A small module for wrapping over environment variables (pulled from ``os.environ``)
which provides convenience methods to fetch and check various data types
(including iterables) in what I'd charitably hope is a sensible way.

Explicitly doesn't attempt to read from any ``.env`` or ``.envrc`` file, because that
doesn't describe valid examples or which things may/should be set into the
environment. It becomes an absolute pot-luck.

Tracks requested environment variables and their default/fallback/example values, and
whether or not the fallback was used. Never tracks the actual environment value.

If this package isn't to your liking, there's **plenty** of others, and I'm
largely suffering from *Not-Invented-Here syndrome*.

All methods exposed by the Environment accept a key and a default.

- The key is the environment variable to search for.
- The default **MUST** be a string, as it is subject to the same parsing as if it had
  been found in the environment, and thus serves as a documented example of a valid
  value to export as an environment variable. Enforced value documentation!

A series of examples
--------------------

A short overview of all of the available check/cast methods on an ``Environment`` follows

Assume all examples are prefixed with::

    from enviable import env

which is roughly equivalent to::

    from enviable import Environment
    import os
    env = Environment(os.environ)

Remember, the **second** argument (``default``) is always a string, and always
gets parsed the same as a real value, so treat it as an example value in the following...

Conversions and validations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To trim any accidental quotes or whitespace from the beginning and end of the value::

    env.text("VAR_NAME", "'   test '") == "test"

To convert an incoming string to an integer::

    env.int("VAR_NAME", "3") == 3

To convert an incoming string to real boolean (``True`` or ``False``), note
that upper or lower case doesn't matter::

    env.bool("VAR_NAME", "true") is True
    env.bool("VAR_NAME", "on") is True
    env.bool("VAR_NAME", "1") is True
    env.bool("VAR_NAME", "yes") is True
    env.bool("VAR_NAME", "y") is True

    env.bool("VAR_NAME", "false") is False
    env.bool("VAR_NAME", "off") is False
    env.bool("VAR_NAME", "0") is False
    env.bool("VAR_NAME", "no") is False
    env.bool("VAR_NAME", "n") is False

To make a ``uuid.UUID`` from an optionally hyphenated string::

    env.uuid("VAR_NAME", "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa") == UUID('aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa')
    env.uuid("VAR_NAME", "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa") == UUID('aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa')

To *check* if an email *looks* valid::

    env.email("VAR_NAME", "a@b.com") == "a@b.com"

To verify if a string is all hexi characters::

    env.hex("VAR_NAME", "abcdef12345ABCDEF") == "abcdef12345ABCDEF"

Confirm that a string can be decoded from a base64 encoded value::

    env.b64("VAR_NAME", "d29vZg==") == 'd29vZg=='

There's no support for ``float`` because it's lossy, but you can have decimals::

    env.decimal("VAR_NAME", "1.25") == Decimal("1.25")

To confirm that a string looks like it might be an importable python thing::

    env.importable("VAR_NAME", "path.to.my.module") == "path.to.my.module"

To make sure a string represents an existing, *readable* file on disk::

    env.filepath("VAR_NAME", "/path/to/my/valid_file.json") == "/path/to/my/valid_file.json"

To make sure a string is a directory which exists::

    env.directory("VAR_NAME", "/path/to/my") == "/path/to/my"

To *vaguely* sanity-check URLs (must start with ``http://`` or ``https://`` or ``//`` or ``/...``)::

    env.web_address("VAR_NAME", "http://example.com/")

To constrain a value to one of a few valid options (where ``choices`` is parsed the same way as `Iterables`_)::

    env.one_of("VAR_NAME", "3", choices="1,2,3,4")

and to go off-reservation, you can get JSON out, or the raw environment string::

    env.json("VAR_NAME", "{}") == {}
    env.raw("VAR_NAME", "'   ...  '") == "'   ...  '"

Temporal values (datetimes, dates, times)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have `Django`_ installed (because that's my main use case and I'm lazy)
you can also get datetimes if you provide a value in ISO 8601 format::

    env.datetime("VAR_NAME", "2019-11-21 16:12:56.002344")
    env.datetime("VAR_NAME", "2019-11-21 16:12:56.002344+20:00")
    env.datetime("VAR_NAME", "2019-11-21")

Similarly you can ask for dates::

    env.date("VAR_NAME", "2019-11-21")
    env.date("VAR_NAME", "2019-11-2")
    env.date("VAR_NAME", "2019-3-2")

or times::

    env.time("VAR_NAME", "13:13:13.000123")
    env.time("VAR_NAME", "13:13:13.123")
    env.time("VAR_NAME", "13:13:13")
    env.time("VAR_NAME", "13:13")

Iterables
^^^^^^^^^

It's additionally possible to consume a string and cast it to a sequence etc::

    env.tuple("VAR_NAME", "123,4356,235") == ("123", "4356", "235")
    env.list("VAR_NAME", "123,4356,235") == ["123", "4356", "235"]
    env.set("VAR_NAME", "123,4356,235") == {"123", "4356", "235"}
    env.frozenset("VAR_NAME", "123,4356,235") == {"123", "4356", "235"}
    env.dict("VAR_NAME", "a=1, b=2, c=3") == {"a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "3"}

Commas are treated as delimiters, and may optionally have a single space after each one.

Leading python-iterable characters are dropped if they are present from both sides,
and their python type is ignored::

    env.tuple("VAR_NAME", "[123, 4356, 235]") == ("123", "4356", "235")
    env.tuple("VAR_NAME", "(123, 4356, 235)") == ("123", "4356", "235")
    env.tuple("VAR_NAME", "{123, 4356, 235}") == ("123", "4356", "235")

Casting on iterables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using any of ``env.tuple``, ``env.list``, ``env.set``, ``env.frozenset``,
or ``env.dict`` allows each parsed value to be validated and optionally cast,
with the caveat that the *iterable is homogenous* (that is, everything can be
converted to an ``int`` or a ``uuid`` or whatever)

Each value may be cast to any of the non-iterable methods documented above, by using
``env.ensure.methodname`` instead of ``env.methodname``, for example::

    env.tuple("VAR_NAME", "123,4356,235", converter=env.ensure.int) == (123, 4356, 235)
    env.set("VAR_NAME", "123,4356,235", converter=env.ensure.hex) == {"123", "4356", "235"}
    env.list("VAR_NAME", "a@b.com, b@c.com, def@ghi", env.ensure.email) == ['a@b.com', 'b@c.com', 'def@ghi']

``env.dict`` is slightly special in that it has arguments for ``key_converter`` and ``value_converter``
so that keys can have a different type to values. Both must still be homogenous::

    env.dict("VAR_NAME", "a=1, b=2, c=3", key_converter=env.ensure.hex, value_converter=env.ensure.int) == {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}

Handling errors
---------------

Failing to successfully convert (or just validate) the value (whether from
the environment or from the fallback) immediately halts execution by raising
``EnvironmentCastError`` which is a subclass of ``ValueError``.

Failing to provide a **string** for a default/fallback value will
raise ``EnvironmentDefaultError`` which is *also* a subclass of ``ValueError``.

To catch any *anticipated* error then, is to::

    try:
        ...
    except (EnvironmentCastError, EnvironmentDefaultError) as e:
        ...

Checking for existence
----------------------

To find out if an environment variable is set, *regardless of it's value*, you can
use normal ``in`` testing::

    if "MY_KEY" in env:
        do_something_special()

which allows you to change behaviour based on seeing certain variables in the
running environment.

Tracking the requests
---------------------

Every access of an ``Environment`` (eg: the default ``env``) keeps an internal
log of the key requested + whether or not it was found and used in the environment.

These are available under ``env.used`` and ``env.fallbacks`` but may be accessed
together by iterating over the ``Environment`` in question, where each iteration
will yield a ``3-tuple`` of:

- environment variable name requested
- the ``default`` or *fallback* value
- a ``bool`` of whether or not the environment variable was used or whether the fallback was. ``True`` if found in the environment, ``False`` if the fallback was used.

For example, to output everything, you might do::

    from enviable import env, Environment
    import sys
    env.int("TEST", "4")
    myenv = Environment({"TESTING": "1"})
    myenv.bool("TESTING", "0")
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        for env_var_name, env_var_example, was_read_from_env in env:
            if was_read_from_env is True:
                sys.stdout.write("{} was in the environment\n".format(env_var_name))
            else:
                sys.stdout.write("{} was NOT in the environment, used default value of {}\n".format(env_var_name, env_var_example))

Note that in the above scenario, because ``env`` and ``myenv`` are different
instances with their own individual tracking, the request for ``TESTING`` will
not output, but ``TEST`` will.

Running the tests
-----------------

Given a copy of the file ``enviable.py`` you ought to be able to do either of the following::

    $ python enviable.py
    $ python -m enviable

and see the output of the various tests I've bothered with. If mypy is installed,
it will also type-check the file.
