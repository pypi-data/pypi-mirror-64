Description: # Helipad
        
        Helipad is an agent-based modeling framework for Python. It differs from other frameworks in that it focuses on time series output rather than spatial models.
        
        Documentation is a work in progress, and can be found at https://helipad.dev
        
        ## How to use
        
        	from model import Helipad
        	heli = Helipad()
        	
        	#Use the heli object to set up here
        	
        	heli.launchGUI()
        
        A bootstrap model is included to get started. See the documentation for more usage details.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Helipad requires Python 3.6. Previous versions do not preserve dict order, so you may get unexpected results. Python 2 is not supported.
        
        The following libraries are required:
        
        * Colour (for the user interface)
        * Matplotlib (for plotting the time series output)
        * Pandas (for data collection)
        
        The following libraries are optional but recommended:
        
        * Readline (for the debug console)
        * Code (for the debug console)
        * PMW (for tooltips)
        * NetworkX (for network analysis)
        * Pyobjc (for Mac interface niceties)
        
        ## Version History
