Web Templates
=============

This project hopes to cater for the situation that one is working through a tutorial for their selected web framework and reads "Provide a base template for your website". 
Your thinking that's probably important perhaps there is a standardized template only to realise that "The cake is not real".

This package provides skeletal HTML templates for the different Python web frameworks one has used and will gladly accept contributions for the ones you are using.
Hopefully, after a period of time this project might present the standard for such templates.

Background 
----------

A number of Python web frameworks and template engines exist none of which appear to offer a standardized base template.
As a result each extention to these frameworks provides its own variation of a "base" HTML template.

This package hopes to provide a standardized **skeleton** for such packages and indeed the frameworks themselves.

Purpose
-------

This package provides `skeleton` templates for other packages to extend.
`skeleton` was chosen since it is less likely to clash with more customary terms, `base` and `layout`, used within web framework packages and their extentions.
These `skeleton(s)` provide a standard structure, outlined by the package documentation, and are named and organized according to how they are processed ::

    BACKEND_FRAMEWORK[/EXTENTION(S)][/FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK][/EXTENTION(S)]/skeleton.TEMPLATE_ENGINE.html

.. rubric:: Example

A template for the `RESTful` package, which exists for both `Django` as `Django-RESTfull` and `Flask` as `Flask-ReSTful`, might exist under the following paths ::

    flask/flask-RESTful/skeleton.jinja2.html
    flask/flask-RESTful/skeleton.mako.html
    django/django-RESTful/skeleton.DTL.html
    django/django-RESTful/skeleton.jinja2.html

Installation
------------

The package can be installed directly through `pip` ::

    pip install Web-Templates

Bleeding edge installations may be done directly from the repository ::

    pip install git+https://gitlab.com/manaikan/web-templates.git

Documentation
-------------

Documentation are available at `Gitlab.io <https://manaikan.gitlab.io/web-templates>`_.
