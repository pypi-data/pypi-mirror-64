        ==========
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This python module provides an asynchroneous version of ping. It is based on the trio framework.
        
        Information about this module can be found here:
        
        * [github.org](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/....)
        * [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jk_trioping)
        
        Why this module?
        ----------------
        
        It is not too difficult to perform a ping to multiple hosts in parallel. Suprisingly modules, examples or even binaries to do exactly that are hard to find. This modules now offers a simple solution to that problem.
        
        How to use this module
        ----------------------
        
        ### Import this module
        
        Please include this module into your application using the following code:
        
        ```python
        import trio
        import jk_trioping
        ```
        
        ### Perform single ping
        
        ```python
        async def main(hostAddress):
        	ret = await jk_trioping.ping(
        		host = hostAddress,
        		timeout = 2,
        		repeats = 1
        	)
        	print(ret)
        
        trio.run(main, "127.0.0.1")
        ```
        
        This will perform a single ping to a single host. The result will look something like this:
        
        ```
        0.063
        ```
        
        ### Perform multiple pings
        
        ```python
        async def main(hostAddresses):
        	ret = await jk_trioping.multiPing(
        		hosts = hostAddresses,
        		timeout = 2,
        		repeats = 1
        	)
        	print(ret)
        
        trio.run(main, [ "127.0.0.1", "localhost" ])
        ```
        
        This will perform a ping to two hosts (addressing one by IP address, one by name) and print something like this:
        
        ```
        {'localhost': 0.071, '127.0.0.1': 0.073}
        ```
