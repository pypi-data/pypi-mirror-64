Home service is a simple IoT server that serves REST endpoints for
IoT devices to post sensor data, and a simple web interface for monitoring.

Invoking the command `home-service` will start the server. This is preferably
wrapped in a systemd service and ran as a daemon. Containerised deployment options
are being worked on.


### Installation

Using pip:

```bash
python3 -m pip install home-service
```
