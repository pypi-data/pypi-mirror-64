<h1>stucco_auth</h1>
<p>This is the example application included with stucco_auth. You can log in
and out. That's all there is to it.</p>
<p>TODO: There is an admin user by default. Its password is output by
a log.info() call in create.py if it is building a new database
(scroll up after running 'paster serve development.ini' the first time).</p>
