Description: stucco_auth
        ===========
        
        SQLAlchemy-backed username/password authentication for the Pyramid web 
        framework.
        
        What You Get
        ------------
        
        - Versioned schema with stucco_evolution
        - SQLAlchemy-mapped User, Group, and Settings classes
        - BCRYPT password encryption with cryptacular
        - Pyramid views to login and logout
        - Traversal, not routes
        - Jinja2 templates for the views
        - Uni-Form CSS themed login form
        - YUI 3 CSS in the base template
        - 99% test coverage
        
        What You Don't Get
        ------------------
        
        - Any express or implied warranties, including, without limitation, the
          implied warranties of merchantibility and fitness for a particular purpose.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        It's easy enough to add the stucco_auth views to your application by calling::
        
        	from pyramid.config import Configurator
        	config = Configurator(...)
        	config.include('stucco_auth.config')
        	
        Unfortunately, stucco_auth requires many things from a host Pyramid application
        before it will work properly:
        
        - A configured authentication and authorization policy. Login and logout views
          don't make sense otherwise.
        - A transaction-managed SQLAlchemy session made available as request.db
        - stucco_auth's schema instantiated into that database
        - request.session for flash messages
        - Jinja2 templating
        - A stucco_auth.interfaces.IAuthRoot instance in the resource tree. login/ and
          logout/ are resolved relative to this object.
        
        The demo application, stucco_auth.main(), provides one example of how to set
        this up.
