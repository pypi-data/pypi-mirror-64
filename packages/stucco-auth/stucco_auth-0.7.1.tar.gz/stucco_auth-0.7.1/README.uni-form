### What is Uni–Form 

Uni-Form is a framework that standardizes form markup and styles it with CSS 
giving you two most widely used layout options to choose from. Anyone can get nice 
looking, well structured, highly customizable, accessible and usable forms. To put 
it simply: it makes a developer's life a lot easier. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to Use? 

First thing you need to do is to link up the necessary files: 

    * Link up the main CSS file
    
      <link href="path/to/file/uni-form.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet"/>
    
    * Link up the Uni–Form style CSS file
      
      <link href="path/to/file/default.uni-form.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet"/>
    
    * Optionally you'll want to link up jQuery and Uni–Form jQuery files if you'd 
      like Uni–Form to highlight the form rows on focus (it's a usability aid): 
      
      <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
      <script src="path/to/file/uni-form.jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 

Now that you're all set up, all you need to do is add form fields that are formatted
with Uni–Form markup so the CSS and JavaScript will get the “hooks” they need. These
chunks of code are called “units” and all available units can be found within the 
file called fauxform.html that is included in this package. 

Feel free to extend Uni–Form with units of your own and share. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Styles 

As of v1.4 Uni–Form supports styles. These are separate CSS files that contain the
presentation aspect of your form (considering that uni-form.css) contains the 
layout. Style CSS files should be used to control how your form looks, spacing… 

Sharing styles is encouraged, and by default Uni–Form is shipped with three: 

    * Default
    * Blue 
    * Dark 
    
Consider these a starting point for making your own. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Options and Layout Control 

Uni–Form by default has two form layouts: default and inline. This is controlled 
by adding (or removing) a CSS class .inlineLabels to the fieldset element. 

There is another option in regards to the layout and it concerns what is referred 
to as “multifields”. These are fields that contain multiple inputs per unit and 
are usually used for checkboxes and radio buttons. Each layout supports an 
alternate multifield layout. This is achieved by adding (or removing) a CSS class
.alternate to the ul element.

                          Give respect and get it back.
