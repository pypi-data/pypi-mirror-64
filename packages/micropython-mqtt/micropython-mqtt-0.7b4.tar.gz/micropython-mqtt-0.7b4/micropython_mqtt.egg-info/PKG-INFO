Description: MQTT client for Micropython using asyncio.
        The implementation requires the new (in 2020) uasyncio built into Micropython. It provides
        an MQTTClient class that operates in the background (using the asyncio loop) and makes
        callbacks for incoming messages. MQTTClient supports QoS 0 and QoS messages, and it supports
        non-blocking publishing of messages to improve streaming performance.
        MQTTClient automatically reconnects if the connection to the broker fails and also
        automatically connects and reconnects Wifi should it drop.
        The API is largely compatible with Peter Hinch's mqtt_as.
