            This works well when logging in from a public page which looks different when logged in.
            On such pages, you should include a login link with ?return=True as the query string.

            TODO - the downside to this approach, is that chrome doesn't prompt to save password
            (it seems to be waiting for the creation of a new history entry to do that)
            You can still manually save the password (from the "key" in the address bar).

            I really don't see how we can achieve this flow and still make chrome prompt to save.
            I guess it's up to the site developer if they want to use the "return" feature or not.
