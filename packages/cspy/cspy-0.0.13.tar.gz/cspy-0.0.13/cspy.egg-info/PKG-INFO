Description: cspy
        ====
        
        A collection of algorithms for the (resource) Constrained Shortest Path
        (CSP) problem.
        
        The CSP problem was popularised by `Inrich 2005`_. 
        It was initially introduced as a subproblem for the bus
        driver scheduling problem, and has since then widely studied in a
        variety of different settings including: the vehicle routing problem
        with time windows (VRPTW), the technician routing and scheduling
        problem, the capacitated arc-routing problem, on-demand transportation
        systems, and, airport ground movement; among others.
        
        More generally, in the applied column generation framework, particularly
        in the scheduling related literature, the CSP problem is commonly
        employed to generate columns.
        
        Therefore, this library is of interest to the operational research
        community, students and academics alike, that wish to solve an instance
        of the CSP problem.
        
        Algorithms
        ----------
        
        Currently, the algorithms implemented include:
        
        -  Monodirectional forward labeling algorithm;
        -  Monodirectional backward labeling algorithm;
        -  Bidirectional labeling algorithm with dynamic halfway point `Tilk et al 2017`_;
        -  Heuristic Tabu search;
        -  Greedy elimination procedure;
        -  Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). Adapted from
           `Ferone et al 2019`_;
        - Particle Swarm Optimization with combined Local and Global Expanding Neighborhood Topology (PSOLGET) (`Marinakis et al 2017`_).
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Generic resource extension functions (`Inrich 2005`_) (not restricted to additive resources);
        - Generic resource consumptions (not restricted to non-negative values).
