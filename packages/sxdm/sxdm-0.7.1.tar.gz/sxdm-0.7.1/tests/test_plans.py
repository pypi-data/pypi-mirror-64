        #check to see if scan_numbers are the same
        #if not erase the ones stored
        #if no values then create scan_numbers and scan_angles

        #alignment data

    #Determine the shape of all imported files

    #Determine the resolution of all the imported files
        #if different resolution tell user that certain files have different resolution
        #set limit for resolution differences
        #will be addressed in new version

    #if the same resoltion but different shapes then sore how many rows and columns to add to the small arrays
