This program automatically generates PowerPoints about any topic.
These presentation slide decks can be used by improvisers for the improvisational comedy format *"Improvised TED talk"* or *"Powerpoint Karaoke"*.
In such games, the actors have to present an unseen presentation slide deck, but pretend to be an expert and explain *"their"* slide show choices.

## Demo

Ty out this generator on our online platform: [talkgenerator.com](http://talkgenerator.com/).

### Example

![Automatically Generated](https://media.giphy.com/media/MXXe522nIAA9JZjExI/giphy.gif)

## Easy Install and Run

Our program relies on certain APIs that require authentication in order to use it.
Create a file named `.env` (don't forget the period) in your project directory, and fill this with the correct API keys as described on our [wiki page about this](https://github.com/korymath/talk-generator/wiki/Setting-Up-API-Keys).

```sh
# Make a new Python 3 virtual environment 
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip and install  requirements
pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download NLTK dependencies
python3 -m nltk.downloader punkt averaged_perceptron_tagger

# Install the Talk Generator 
pip install -e .

# Generate a 10 slide talk with topic peanuts
talkgenerator --topic "peanuts" --num_slides 10
```

### Run arguments

| Argument               | Description               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `topic` | The topic of the generator. This works best if it is a common, well-known noun. Use comma-separated words to generate a slide deck about multiple topics |
| `slides` | The number of slides in the generated presentation (*default: 10*) |
| `schema` | The presentation schema to use when generating the presentation. Currently, only two modes are implemented, being `default` and `test` (for testing during development) |
| `title` | Title of the presentation. Either `topic` or this one should to be set in order to generate a slide deck (just setting `topic` is usually more fun though)  |
| `presenter` | The name that will be present on the first slide. Leave blank for an automatically generated name |
| `output_folder` | The folder to output the generated presentations (*default: `./output/`*) |
| `save_ppt` | If this flag is true(*default*), the generated powerpoint will be saved on the computer in the `output_folder`|
| `open_ppt` | If this flag is true (*default*), the generated powerpoint will automatically open after generating|
| `parallel` | If this flag is true (*default*), the generator will generate all slides in parallel |

## Program structure

See the [wiki](https://github.com/korymath/talk-generator/wiki/Program-structure) to know more about the inner implementation.

## Tests
Test files are `tests/*.py`, prefixed with `test_`. Test files use the `unittest` module.
They can easily be run all together when using PyCharm by right clicking on `talk-generator` and pressing *Run 'Unittests in talk-generator'*

```sh
. venv/bin/activate
pytest --cov=talkgenerator tests/
```

Test coverage is automatically handled by `codecov`. Tests are automatically run with CircleCI based on the `.yml` file in the `.circleci` directory.
