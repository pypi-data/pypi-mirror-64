=========
pyProdigy
=========
A simple package to work with Prodigy ALMA data 

Installation
------------

**uvplot** works on `Python` >=2.7 and >=3.6 and can be installed with:

.. code-block :: bash

    pip install pyProdigy

To make **pyProdigy** available in CASA, run from the shell:

.. code-block :: bash

    casa-pip install pyProdigy

where `casa-pip` is a tool that can be downloaded at `https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/casa-python <https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/casa-python>`_.

To upgrade **pyProdigy** to a newer version on your system, just run:

.. code-block :: bash

    pip install --upgrade pyProdigy

To upgrade **pyProdigy** inside CASA use the `--no-deps` option to prevent `casa-pip` from automatically upgrading `numpy` and `matplotlib` (which is not allowed inside CASA and will lead to errors):

.. code-block :: bash

    casa-pip install --upgrade --no-deps pyProdigy

**pyProdigy** has been tested on CASA versions >= 5.6.0.
