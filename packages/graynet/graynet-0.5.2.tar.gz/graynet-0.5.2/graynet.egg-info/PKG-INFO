Description: 
        Individualized single-subject networks from T1-weighted MRI features such as:
          - Cortical thickness
          - Gray matter density
          - Subcortical morphometric features
          - Gyrification and curvature
        
        Applicable for whenever network-level features are useful, among which common use cases are: 
         - Biomarker development.
         - Brain-behaviour relationships (e.g. for the diagnosis and prognosis of many brain disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Schizophrenia and the like).
         - Aging (changes in network properties over age and their relations to other variables).
