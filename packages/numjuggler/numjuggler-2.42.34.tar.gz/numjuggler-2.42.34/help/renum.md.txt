DESCRIPTION


The --mode renum is the default mode. Cells, surfaces, materials
transformations and universes are renamed according to the -c, -s, -m,
-u, -t or --map command line options. The original MCNP input file is
not modified, the input file with renamed elements is written to
standard output.



OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS


In this mode, the cell, surface, material, transformation and/or
universe numbers are modified by adding terms, specified in the command
line.

The following command line options are used to specify terms to be
added:

-   -c <expr> for cells
-   -s <expr> for surfaces
-   -m <expr> for materials
-   -t <expr> for transformations
-   -u <expr> for universes
-   --map <filename> for any objects (see below)

Each of the above flags except --map must be followed by an expression
<expr> that defines the term to be addedto the original number. This
expression can be one of the following:

-   <N> -- simple integer value. This value is added to all cells,
    materials, etc.
-   i -- the character 'i'. In this case, the corresponding objects in
    the input files are numbered with increasing numbers starting from 1
    (indexed).

The --map flag must be followed by a file name of the map file. When
both --map and one of the -c, -s etc. flags is given, the latter is
used.



INVOCATION EXAMPLES


All cells number in the input file input.orig are increased by 10. The
resulting input file is written to standard output and redirected to
input.new:

    >numjuggler              -c 10 input.orig > input.new
    >numjuggler --mode renum -c 10 input.orig > input.new

Both variants are equal, since the --mode renum is the default one.
Similar, one can specify terms to be added to surfaces, materials and
transformations, repsectively with the -s, -m and -t command line
arguments:

    >numjuggler -s 5 -m 10 -t 100 input.orig > input.new

In this example, surface numbers are increased by 5, material numbers
are increased by 10 (zero material remains unchanged) and all
transformation numbers are increased by 100.

More complex renaming rules can be deifned in the map file. Here one can
specify different renaming rules for different cells or cell ranges. For
example:

    >numjuggler --map map.txt input.orig > input.new

where map.txt is a text file, which format is described in details here:
map file format.
