DESCRIPTION


Change cell densities according to the map file.

In the map file one can specify coefficients to multiply the original
input file densities. The coefficients can be specified for particular
cells and/or materials (or their ranges -- see descritpion of the map
file format).


Rationale

One of the approaches to get the fist guess for the mesh weight-window
through the model geometry is to decrease all material densities by
several orders of magnitude and perform particle transport to generate
the weight window mesh.


Invocation example

in the following example, the map file is densities.txt, the original
input file is input.orig and the new input file is written to input.new:

    >numjuggler --mode cdens --map densities.txt input.orig > input.new

The content of densities.txt:

    c 1 -- 10: 0.01  # In cells 1 to 10 multiply density by 0.01
    c 12: 0.1        # Multiply cell 12 density by 0.1

    m 5: 1e-3        # For all cells filled with material 5 multiply density by 1e-3
