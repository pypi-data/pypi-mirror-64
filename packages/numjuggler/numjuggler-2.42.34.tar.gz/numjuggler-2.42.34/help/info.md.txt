DESCRIPTION


The input file is analysed and ranges of used numbers for cells,
surfaces, ets. are written to the standard output. Note that the output
of this mode can be used (after necessary modifications) as the input to
the --map option.

The first two columns specify type (cells, surfaces, etc.) and the range
of used numbers. The third column shows the amount of numbers in current
range, and the last column shows how many numbers left unused between
the current and previous ranges.



INVOCATION EXAMPLE


The input file input.orig is analysed and the result is redirected to
info.txt:

    >numjuggler --mode info input.orig > info.txt
