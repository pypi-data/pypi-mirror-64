NUMJUGGLER


About

Numjuggler is a command line tool to perform specific tasks on the MCNP
input files.

Originally, it was developed at INR-KIT to rename cells, surfaces and
materials in the MCNP input file. This task appeared often within the
framework of ITER nuclear analyses, where different parts of the MCNP
computational model were developed independently by different
organizations and than merged together to the model describing the whole
ITER facility. The merging of the model parts into a single MCNP input
file was often complicated by the use of the same cell, surface and
material numbers in the different model parts.

Later, other features was added to numjuggler. Now it can be run in one
of the execution modes, each performing particular task.

The original development was previously conducted in the inr-kit
repository. The author of numjuggler has its own fork at
travleev/numjuggler.


Installation

TODO: the best way -- clone from travleev/numjuggler and install in the
"development mode" using pip: pip install -e ..

TODO: try under windows/anaconda(?)


Invocation

numjuggler is a command line tool written in Python. When properly
installed, it can be invoked in one of the following ways:

    >numjuggler           --mode <modename> [arguments] input.txt > input.new
    >python -m numjuggler --mode <modename> [arguments] input.txt > input.new

These two invocation forms are equal. The command line arguments in
general contain the only necessary argument -- the original MCNP input
file (in the above example input.txt). The output is written to standard
output that can be redirected to a file. The execution mode is specified
after the --mode flag. The other optional arguments can contain
additional arguments relevant to the chosen mode.
