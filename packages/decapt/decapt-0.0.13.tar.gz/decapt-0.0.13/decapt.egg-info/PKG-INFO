Description: # Simple declarative package management
        ## For Debianish Linux
        
        Declarative package management means you make a file containing everything you want installed, and the package manager adds/removes to make the system match that.  It's good if you happen to install lots of random programs and forget to remove them until you forgot whether they were important to have installed or not in the first place!
        
        Requires: aptitude, sudo, python 3.6+
        
        1. `pip install decapt`
        2. `decapt generate`
        3. Modify `decapt.luxem`
        4. Update your system with `decapt`
        
        ## Features
        
        * Manage snap packages
        * Manage manual debian packages
          Add an entry like `{ name: mypackage, path: ~/debs/mypackage }` where there's a `build.sh` script in `path` which creates a `mypackage.deb` in `path`.

        ## Notes
        
        Debian seems to "manually" install a lot of unnecessary packages?  To convert all manually installed packages to auto packages, run:
        
        ```
        $ sudo apt-mark showmanual | while read line; do if [[ $(apt-cache rdepends --installed $line | wc -l) -ne 2 ]]; then apt-mark auto $line; fi; done
        ```
        
        If you do `decapt generate` after that you should have a smaller list of base-system spam in the list.
