README
======

This package provides a long-running command to measure network performance.

Following figures are recorded to a csv file:

* packets sent
* packets received
* network latency

Prerequisites
-------------

* ``Python >= 3.7``, due to usage of ``dataclasses`` and ``annotations``;
* Normally handled nicely py installation procedure: ``click``, ``requests``,
  and ``psutil`` third-party libraries.

Installation
------------

This package is hosted on `Pypi`, so it's as easy as:

    pip install connection-monitor

Usage
-----

Open a terminal, activate the virtualenv if appropriate, and simply type::

    monitor

Available options:

* ``-o FILENAME``

  Filename to write the stats into. By default, the stats go in current
  folder, in file named ``'network_data.csv'``.

  Writing is in append mode; previous data is kept.

* ``-h HOST``

  Address to connect to, to measure latency. Currently defaults to
  ``'http://siinergy.net'`` (my company server).

* ``-v``

  Verbosity of the logging message. Use it to show measurements to command
  line.
